O R D E R
	CIVIL APPEAL NO.617 OF 2008
  (arising out of SLP(C)No.21000 of 2006)

	Leave granted.
	Heard the parties.
	The order impugned being an interim order we see no reason to interfere. 
However, since Writ Petition No.15540/2006 is now pending for disposal before the 
High Court in which the question of law has been raised we dispose of this appeal 
with a request to the High Court to dispose of Writ Petition NO.15540/2006 within 
three months from today.  Till such time the writ petition is disposed of, the interim 
order passed by this Court on 08.01.2007 shall continue.
