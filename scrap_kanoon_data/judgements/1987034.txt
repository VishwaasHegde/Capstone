(Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No. 6153/2007)


								                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
	Delay condoned.

	Leave granted.

	We have heard learned counsel for the parties.

	Reading of the judgment of the High Court makes it clear that nobody appeared on 
behalf of the appellants-accused (herein also appellants),  before the High Court and 
the matter was proceeded and decided on merits. The High Court dismissed the 
appeal.

	On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, in our opinion, it would be 
appropriate if we set aside the order passed by the High Court and remit the matter to 
the High Court for fresh disposal in accordance with law.  If the appellants are not 
represented by the time the matter comes up for hearing, the High Court will appoint 
Amicus Curiae and decide the case in accordance with law.  

	The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of.

			    : 2 :
	We request the High Court to decide the matter as expeditiously as possible since the 
appellants are in jail.
