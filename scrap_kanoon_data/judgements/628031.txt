       In view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, learned counsel for the parties do

not want to press these appeals as the same have become infructuous.               The appeals are

accordingly disposed of as having become infructuous.

       However, if the compromise petition is not filed in the suit, it will be open to either of the

parties to apply for recall of the order.
