           Versus

                            JUDGMENT

P. Sathasivam, J.

1)   Ms. Pareena Swarup, member of the Bar, has filed this

writ petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution of India by way

of Public Interest Litigation seeking to declare various sections

of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 such as

Section    6   which       deals   with   adjudicating    authorities,

composition, powers etc., Section 25 which deals with the

establishment of Appellate Tribunal, Section 27 which deals

with composition etc. of the Appellate Tribunal, Section 28

which     deals     with    qualifications   for   appointment         of

Chairperson and Members of the Appellate Tribunal, Section

                                                                   1
32 which deals with resignation and removal, Section 40

which deals with members etc. as ultra vires of Arts. 14, 19 (1)

(g), 21, 50, 323B of the Constitution of India.        It is also

pleaded that these provisions are in breach of scheme of the

Constitutional provisions and power of judiciary.

2)   Brief facts in a nutshell are:

The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (hereinafter

referred to as "the Act") was introduced for providing

punishment for offence of Money Laundering.         The Act also

provides measures of prevention of money laundering.         The

object sought to be achieved is by provisional attachment of

the proceeds of crime, which are likely to be concealed,

transferred or dealt with in any manner which may result in

frustrating any proceedings relating to confiscation of such

proceeds under the Act.      The Act also casts obligations on

banking companies, financial institutions and intermediaries

to maintain record of the transactions and to furnish

information of such transactions within the prescribed time.

In exercise of powers conferred by clause (s) of sub-section (2)

of Section 73 read with Section 30 of the Prevention of Money-


                                                             2
Laundering Act, 2002 (15 of 2003), the Central Government

framed rules regulating the appointment and conditions of

service of persons appointed as Chairperson and Members of

the Appellate Tribunal.     These rules are the Prevention of

Money-Laundering (Appointment and Conditions of Service of

Chairperson and Members of Appellate Tribunal) Rules, 2007.

The Central Government has also framed rules called the

Prevention of Money Laundering (Appointment and Conditions

of Service of Chairperson and Members of Adjudicating

Authorities) Rules, 2007.

3)   It is highlighted that the provisions of the Act are so

provided that there may not be independent judiciary to

decide the cases under the Act but the Members and the

Chairperson are to be selected by the Selection Committee

headed by the Revenue Secretary.     It is further pointed out

that the Constitutional guarantee of a free and independent

judiciary, and the constitutional scheme of separation of

powers can be easily and seriously undermined, if the

legislatures were to divest the regular Courts of their

jurisdiction in all matters, entrust the same to the newly

                                                          3
created Tribunals. According to the petitioner, the statutory

provisions of the Act and the Rules, more particularly, relating

to constitution of Adjudicating Authority and Appellate

Tribunal are violative of basic constitutional guarantee of free

and independent judiciary, therefore, beyond the legislative

competence of the Parliament. The freedom from control and

potential domination of the executive are necessary pre-

conditions for the independence.        With these and various

other grounds, the petitioner has filed this public interest

litigation seeking to issue a writ of certiorari for quashing the

abovesaid   provisions   which    are   inconsistent   with   the

separation of power and interference         with the judicial

functioning of the Tribunal as ultra vires of the Constitution of

India.

4)   The respondent-Union of India has filed counter affidavit

repudiating the claim of the petitioner.       The Department

highlighted that the impugned Act has not ousted the

jurisdiction of any courts and sufficient safeguards are

provided in the appointment of officers of the Adjudicating




                                                              4
Authorities, Members and Chairperson of the Appellate

Tribunal.

5)   We have carefully verified the provisions of the Act and

the Rules, particularly, relating to constitution and selection of

Adjudicating Authorities, Members and Chairperson of the

Appellate Tribunal.          Considering the stand taken by the

petitioner with reference to those provisions, we requested Mr.

K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel, to assist the Court.

Pursuant to the suggestion made by the Court, Mr. K.K.

Venugopal and Mr. Gopal Subramaniam, learned Additional

Solicitor     General,    discussed      the    above    issues    and     by

consensus submitted certain proposals.

6)   The petitioner has highlighted the following defects in the

Adjudicating Authority Rules, 2007 and the Appellate Tribunal

Rules, 2007:-

1.          Rule 3(3) of Adjudicating Authority Rules, 2007 does not
            explicitly specify the qualifications of member from the field of
            finance or accountancy.

2.          Rule 4 of Appellate Tribunal Rules, 2007 which provided for
            Method of Appointment of Chairperson do not give adequate
            control to Judiciary.


                                                                          5
3.      Rule 6(1) of Appellate Tribunal Rules, 2007 which defines the
        Selection Committee for recommending appointment of
        Members of the Tribunal, would undermine the constitutional
        scheme of separation of powers between judiciary and
        executives.


4.      Rule 32(2) of PMLA which provides for removal of
        Chairperson/Members of Tribunal under PMLA does not
        provide   adequate  safety    to  the tenure of the
        Chairperson/Members of the Tribunal.

5.      Rule 6(2) of Appellate Tribunal Rules is vague to the extent
        that it provides for recommending names after "inviting
        applications   thereof   by   advertisement    or   on   the
        recommendations of the appropriate authorities."

6.      Section 28(1) of PMLA, which allows a person who "is qualified
        to be a judge of the High Court" to be the Chairperson of the
        Tribunal, should be either deleted or the Rules may be
        amended to provide that the Chief Justice of India shall
        nominate a person for appointment as Chairperson of
        Appellate Tribunal under PMLA "who is or has been a Judge
        of the Supreme Court or a High Court" failing which a person
        who "is qualified to be a judge of the High Court."

7.      The qualifications for Legal Member of the Adjudicating
        Authority should exclude "those who are qualified to be a
        District Judge" and only serving or retired District Judges
        should be appointed. The Chairperson of the Adjudicating
        Authority should be the Legal member.


7)   As regards the above defects in the rules, as observed

earlier, on the request of this Court, Mr. K.K. Venugopal,

learned senior counsel, Mr. Gopal Subramaniam, learned ASG

as well as Ms. Pareena Swarup who has filed this PIL




                                                                   6
suggested certain amendments in the line of the constitutional

provisions as interpreted by this Court in various decisions.



8)   It is necessary that the Court may draw a line which the

executive may not cross in their misguided desire to take

over bit by bit and judicial functions and powers of the State

exercised by the duly constituted Courts. While creating new

avenue of judicial forums, it is the duty of the Government to

see that they are not in breach of basic constitutional scheme

of separation of powers and independence of the judicial

function.   We agree with the apprehension of the petitioner

that the provisions of Prevention of the Money Laundering Act

are so provided that there may not be independent judiciary to

decide the cases under the Act but the Members and the

Chairperson to be selected by the Selection Committee headed

by Revenue Secretary. It is to be noted that this Court in the

case of L. Chandra Kumar vs. Union of India and Ors.,

(1997) 3 SCC 261 has laid down that power of judicial review

over legislative action vested in the High Courts under Article

226 as well as in this Court under Article 32 of the


                                                            7
Constitution is an integral and essential feature of the

Constitution constituting part of the its structure.                The

Constitution guarantees free and independent judiciary and

the constitutional scheme of separation of powers can be

easily and seriously undermined, if the legislatures were to

divest the regular courts of their jurisdiction in all matters,

entrust the same to the newly created Tribunals which are not

entitled to protection similar to the constitutional protection

afforded to the regular Courts.           The independence and

impartiality which are to be secured not only for the Court but

also for Tribunals and their members, though they do not

belong to the `Judicial Service' are entrusted with judicial

powers.     The safeguards which ensure independence and

impartiality are not for promoting personal prestige of the

functionary but for preserving and protecting the rights of the

citizens and other persons who are subject to the jurisdiction

of the Tribunal and for ensuring that such Tribunal will be

able to command the confidence of the public. Freedom from

control   and    potential   domination      of   the   executive   are

necessary       pre-conditions   for   the        independence      and

                                                                    8
impartiality of judges. To make it clear that a judiciary free

from control by the Executive and Legislature is essential if

there is a right to have claims decided by Judges who are free

from potential domination by other branches of Government.

With this background, let us consider the defects pointed out

by the petitioner and amended/proposed provisions of the Act

and the Rules.

9)   Mr. Gopal Subramaniam has informed this Court that

the suggested actions have been completed by amending the

Rules.   Even other wise, according to him, the proposed

suggestions formulated by Mr. K.K. Venugopal would be

incorporated on disposal of the above writ petition.      For

convenience, let us refer the doubts raised by the petitioner

and amended/proposed provisions as well as the remarks of

the department in complying with the same.

                               District Judges, may often have
                               greater    knowledge     of   its
                               provisions and working.

                               3. The Adjudicating Authority is
                               a body of experts from different
                               fields to adjudicate on the issue
                               of confirmation of provisional
                               attachment of property involved
                               in money laundering.          The
                               functions      of     Adjudicating
                               Authority are civil in nature to
                               the extent that it does not decide
                               on the criminality of the offence
                               nor does it have power to levy
                               penalties or impose punishment.

                               4. Adjudication is a function
                               which is performed by Executives
                               under many statutes.         The
