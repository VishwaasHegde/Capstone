                                         IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                              CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                               CIVIL APPEAL NO.3356 OF 2008
                            (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 10129 of 2008)


KASHIRAM PATEL (D) THROUGH LRS. &amp; ORS.                        ...APPELLANT (S)

                                             VERSUS

CHITRAK SATISHBHAI SHAH &amp; ORS.                                          ...RESPONDENT(S)


                                            ORDER

          Leave granted.
           Having heard learned counsel for the respective parties, we are of the view that
 since the Writ Petition is pending decision and the present appeal is only against an interim
 order passed therein, the interest of the parties would be best served if the High Court could
 be requested to hear out the Writ Petition as early as possible.

           We accordingly dispose of the appeal with a request to the High Court to dispose
 of the pending Writ Petition as early as possible, but preferably within a period of three
 months from date.

           In the meantime, the parties are directed to maintain status quo as far as the
 appellants' plot No. 533 and any portion thereof, if included in the proposed road, is
 concerned.
