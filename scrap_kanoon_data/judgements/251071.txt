I.A. No. 91 in CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2335 OF 2006



1. 	This application has been filed for clarification of a judgment and 
order dated 28.04.2006 passed by a Division Bench of this Court in Civil 
Appeal No. 2335 of 2006.  

2. 	The clarification has been sought for on the issue as to whether 
13.05.1992 was the cut-off date for commencement of the period of one year 
for converting supply from 11 KV to 33 KV or higher voltage or the 
surcharge was actually payable with effect from the said date.

3. 	Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion 
that the Company is liable to pay the surcharge with effect from the date of 
expiry of one year from 13.05.1992 and not from 13.05.1992 itself.  The 
relevant paragraph of the judgment of this Court, accordingly, may be 
substituted by the following:

 	For the reasons aforementioned, although Mr. R.K. Jain, the learned 
Senior Counsel appearing for the company, may be right in his submission 
that the Board has no jurisdiction to levy surcharge after 29.01.1992, but as 
the said contention had not been raised and furthermore as notice was issued  
by the court on a limited question, we are of the opinion that the company is 
liable to pay the surcharge with effect from the date of expiry of one year 
from 13.05.1992.  We may furthermore notice that the actual amount of 
surcharge payable from that date has already been paid by the company to 
the Board.  However, in view of our findings aforementioned, there cannot 
be any doubt that the surcharge @ 17 =% was not required to be paid in 
terms of the tariff  notification dated 01.02.1994.  

 	The I.A. is disposed of accordingly.
