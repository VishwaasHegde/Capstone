                             O R D E R

1.   Leave granted.

         2.   Heard   the   learned   counsel     for   the

         parties.

         3.   It has now been brought to the notice of

         this Court that the civil suit filed by the

         appellant has already been withdrawn. A copy

         of the same has already been filed in this



                                                        1
Court with an affidavit. In this view of the

matter, the impugned order is set aside and

the   High   Court    is    directed       to   decide    the

application       filed    by    the    appellant      under

Section      11      of     the        Arbitration        and

Conciliation Act, 1996 for appointment of an

Arbitrator    which        was    registered      as     S.B.

Arbitration Application NO.6 of 2005 before

the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan,

Jaipur Bench. It is expected that the said

application       shall    be    decided    by   the     High

Court as early as possible preferably within

six months from the date of supply of a copy

of this order.

4.    We, however, make it clear that we have

not gone into the merits of the application

under   Section      11    of    the    Arbitration       and

Conciliation Act which shall be decided by

the High Court in accordance with law.

5.    For the reasons aforesaid, the impugned

order is set aside and the appeal is allowed



                                                         2
to the extent indicated above. There will be

no order as to costs.
