TRANSFER PETITION(C) NO. 234 OF 2007


	This is wife's petition for transfer of Divorce Petition No.677/2006 from Civil Judge, 
Senior Division, Raebareli to District Court at Bokaro.  The ground taken is that she is 
staying in Bokaro and she has nobody who would take her to Raebareli and contest the 
suit.  She also does not have any relative to stay at Raebareli.  These are good grounds 
for transfer.

	Accordingly, transfer petition is allowed.  The Divorce Petition No.677/2006 titled as 
Shiv Kumar Singh Vs. Meera Singh, pending before the Civil Judge, Senior Division, 
Raebareli stands transferred to the District Court at Bokaro.
