                         IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
                          CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                        CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5508            OF 2008
                         (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 1449 of 2008)


Union of India &amp; Ors.                                        ....   Appellants

                                          Versus

Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. &amp; Anr.                      ....   Respondents


                                          ORDER

1.           Leave granted.

2.           M/s. Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. filed three refund claims dated 17th

September, 2001 and 31st March, 2003 respectively under Rule 57AC(7) of Central

Excise Rules, 1944.

3.           In this civil appeal we are concerned with Assessment Years 2001-02 and

2002-03.

4.            Suffice it to state that the Respondent herein had filed      Special Civil

Application No. 12251 of 2005 before the Gujarat High Court seeking refund. Vide order

dated 12th August, 2005 the High Court directed the Department to refund the amont of

Rs. 44,20,58,831/- with interest, "as may be admissible in law".

5.           Pursuant to the High Court's order the Assistant Commissioner of Central

Excise paid the refund amount by cheque. However with respect to interest, the question

was examined and it was held that interest was not admissible. This order was not

challenged by the respondent in appeal but the respondent moved the High Court again

in Special Civil Application No. 18121 of 2006 seeking direction to the Department to pay
                                             2

interest.

6.            By the impugned judgment the High Court has allowed the Special Civil

Application with a direction to the Department to pay interest on the refund allowed.

Against the said order the Department has come to this Court by this civil appeal.

7.            The above facts indicate that against the order passed by the Assistant

Commissioner of Central Excise the respondent-assessee had not filed the statutory

appeal against order denying interest but had moved the High Court directly by way of a

writ petition.

8.            This matter was argued for some time before us. Learned counsel Shri

Lakshmi Kumaran, appearing on behalf of the respondents, on instructions, states that

they would withdraw the Special Civil Application No. 18121 of 206 with liberty to file

appeal before the Commissioner (Appeals) within a period of four weeks. Permission

granted. Consequently, the impugned judgment and order is set side and the respondent

is given time to file Statutory Appeal before the Commissioner (Appeals) within four

weeks. It is made clear that both sides would be entitled to take all legal contentions in

this regard before the Appellate Authority. Learned Solicitor General states that if the

appeal is filed within the stipulated period, the said appeal will be decided on merits and

that the Department will not raise any objection with regard to limitation. We further

make it clear that the Appellate Authority will decide the matter uninfluenced by the

observations contained in the impugned judgment of the High Court as also those

contained in its judgment dated 12th August, 2005 in Special Civil Application No.

12251/2005.

              Subject to above, C.A. is dismissed as withdrawn.
