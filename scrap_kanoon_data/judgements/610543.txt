	Heard both sides.

2.	The petitioner in this case is the wife and she is the respondent in a petition filed 
under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for divorce in the Court of ADJ, Ratlam, M.P.  
We are told that the petitioner-wife is now staying with her parents at Dahod (Gujarat).  
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner would not be in a position to 
defend the case at Ratlam.  On the facts and circumstances, this is a fit case for transfer.  We 
direct that the case H.M.P.No.10 A of 2007 titled as Devendra Acharya Vs. Smt.Megha 
Acharya pending in the Court of ADJ IV, Ratlam (M.P.) be transferred to the Court of 
competent jurisdiction at Dahod (Gujarat).  All the records be transmitted to the Court of 
competent jurisdiction at Dahod (Gujarat) by the ADJ IV, Ratlam (M.P.).
3.	The transfer petition is allowed accordingly.
