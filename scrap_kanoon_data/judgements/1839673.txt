  CIVIL APPEAL NO.3178 OF 2008
(Arising out of SLP)No.8565 of 2007)


1.	Delay condoned.
2.	Leave granted.  
3.	Rejoinder Affidavit filed by the appellant be taken on 
record.  
4.	This appeal is directed against an order passed by a 
learned Single Judge of the High court of Delhi at New Delhi in 
CM(M) No. 41 of 2007 by which an order dated 05.10.2006 
passed by the Appellate Court rejecting the petition filed by the 
appellant in the pending appeal for acceptance of additional 
evidence under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure was affirmed.  
5.	We have heard learned counsel for the parties and after 
considering the facts and circumstances of the present case, 
we are of the view that in order to decide the pending appeal in 
which the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure was filed ought to have been taken by the 
appellate Court along with the application for acceptance of 
additional evidence under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure.  In that view of the matter and without going into the 
merits as to whether the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure was rightly rejected by the 
Appellate Court as well as by the High Court, we set aside the 
order of the High Court as well as of the appellate Court 
rejecting the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure and we direct that the appellate Court shall 
decide the pending appeal along with the application under 
Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure on merits 
within a period of three months from the date of supply of a 
copy of this order to the appellate court.  The appeal is allowed 
to the extent indicated above.  There will be no order as to 
costs.  
6.	The view that we have expressed can be supported by a 
decision of this Court in the case of Jaipur Development 
Authority vs. Kailashwati Devi 1997 (7) SCC 297.  
7.	We make it clear that we have not gone into the merits of 
the application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure which is kept open to be decided by the appellate 
court while deciding the appeal.
