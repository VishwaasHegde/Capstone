                                    VERSUS

DEPUTY COMMNR., MANDYA DISTT. &amp; ORS.                              ....RESPONDENT(S)


                            O R D E R

        In our view, the impugned judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court which was

passed under Section 4 of the Karnataka High Court Act, was not passed by a speaking and

reasoned order. In fact, the only order which was passed is as follows :-

                                "We have heard learned counsel for the
                  appellant.
                     2.      We have also gone through the impugned order passed by the
                        learned Single Judge. We entirely agree with the view taken by
                        the learned Single Judge.
                     3. Accordingly, the writ appeal is dismissed."
       In this view of the matter, the impugned judgment is set aside and the matter is remitted

back to the High Court for passing a speaking and reasoned order in accordance with law. The

appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.

       The High Court is requested to decide the appeal in accordance with law preferably within a

period of three months from the date of communication of this order.

       There shall be no order as to costs.
