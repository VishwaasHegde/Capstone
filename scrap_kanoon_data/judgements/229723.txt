O R D E R	

CIVIL APPEAL NO.  4961    OF 2007
	

	Heard the parties.
	The only question on which we allow this appeal and remand the case to 
TDSAT is that the Tribunal considered only the undertaking by the 
respondent herein dated 25.12.2001 in the impugned judgment.  However, 
the Tribunal failed to consider the undertaking by the respondent dated 
24.12.2001.  On this sole ground we are setting aside the order impugned 
passed by the Tribunal.  The matter is remanded to the Tribunal to 
consider both the undertakings i.e. 24/12/2001 and 25/12/2001 and pass an 
appropriate order as deem fit and proper in accordance with law.

	All contentions and arguments of both the parties are open before the 
Tribunal.
