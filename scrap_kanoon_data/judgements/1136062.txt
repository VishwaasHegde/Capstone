O R D E R

	Having heard the arguments of the learned counsel appearing for the parties and 
gone through the judgments of the courts below and the evidence of the witnesses 
particularly the eye witnesses PW.8 and PW.9, we do not find any infirmity in the 
judgment passed by the trial court and that of the High Court upholding the 
conviction and sentence of the accused-appellant. The criminal appeal is, accordingly, 
dismissed.
