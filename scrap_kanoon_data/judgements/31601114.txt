                      CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                         CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.834 OF 2001



Claudio Fernandes                             ...Appellant(s)

                                       Versus

State of Goa                                               ...Respondent(s)


                                    O R D E R

           Heard learned counsel for the parties.
           In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the
sentence of imprisonment awarded against the appellant is fit to be reduced to the
period already undergone as it appears from the record that the appellant has
remained in custody for a period of about nine months.
           Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in-part and while maintaining
conviction of the appellant, sentence of imprisonment awarded against him is reduced
to the period already undergone. The appellant, who is on bail, is discharged from
the liability of bail bonds.

                                                                          ......................J.
