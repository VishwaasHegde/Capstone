	So far as Nasrullah Mansoor @ Nasul Mansoor is concerned, he was facing 
trial in four cases, out of which three cases have been disposed of.  In two cases, 
he has been convicted and in one, he has been acquitted.  Fourth case is still 
pending under the Foreigners' Act as well as the Passport Act in which arguments 
have already been heard on 20th February, 2008.  This incumbent is behind the 
bars since 1993, almost from the last 15 years.  As soon as the decision is delivered 
in the fourth case, necessary steps be taken forthwith for his deportation in 
accordance with law.
	So far as Abdul Qadeer is concerned, we have been informed that a reminder 
has been sent to the Tajikistan Embassy and a copy of the same has already been 
given to Mr. Bheem Singh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner.  
He submits that he has already spoken to the First Secretary of the Tajikistan 
Embassy and they say that they have received the communication and they are 
taking necessary steps for deportation of Abdul Qadeer.  
	Therefore, nothing more remains for the State or for the Union of India to 
take any steps in these petitions.
