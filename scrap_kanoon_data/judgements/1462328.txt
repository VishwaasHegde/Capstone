            These are two appeals by the insurance companies. The High Court has

granted a total compensation of Rs.11,97,000/-.       Aggrieved by   the same,   the

insurance companies are before this Court. The respondent's son was aged about

25 years at the time of his death. We have had discussions with the representatives

from the insurance companies as well as with the father of the deceased, who was

present in person.   We are told that the respondent has already received a sum

around Rs.6 lacs. Both the insurance companies are directed to pay another sum of

Rs.5,55,000/- to be shared equally to the respondent i.e. a sum of Rs.2,75,000/-

each both by the Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. and the United India Insurance Co.Ltd.,

in addition to the amount already paid to the respondent.

            The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
