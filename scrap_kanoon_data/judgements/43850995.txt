	Delay condoned.
	Leave granted.
	Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we are of the view that the 
High Court had erred in not answering the question which, in our opinion, 
was the substantial question of law under Section 260-A of the Income Tax 
Act, 1962.

 	We quote hereinbelow for the sake of convenience the said question:

	Whether the  Appellate Tribunal was right in law and on facts in 
cancelling the penalty levied u/s 18(1)(c) of the W.T. Act, on the ground that 
benefit under the Amnesty Scheme was available to the Assessee, particularly 
when subsequent to search operation, the Assessee itself had revised its 
revenue  on a number of times, which would go to show that the return was

 not voluntary?

	Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside and the matters are remitted 
to the High Court for fresh consideration in accordance with law.

	Accordingly the Tax Appeal Nos.289-295 of 2005 stand restored to the file 
of the High Court. 

	The appeal is disposed of with no order as to costs.
