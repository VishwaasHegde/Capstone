CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 699-700 OF 2006
(With Civil Appeal Nos. 3560 of 2006, 4245, 4675 and 4676 of 2007)

Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.

1.	In these appeals, the only question that arises for 
consideration is whether there was power for condonation of 
delay in seeking a reference under Section 35-H of the Central 
Excise Act, 1944. By our judgment delivered separately in Civil 
Appeal No. 4647 of 2007 we hold that this is not permissible. 
That being so, these appeals deserve to be dismissed which we 
direct.  No costs.
