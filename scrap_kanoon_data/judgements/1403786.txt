(Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.13795 of 2006)


	Though the case was placed under the heading "Incomplete After Notice 
Matters", but both the parties stated that the matter may be heard and finally 
disposed of.
	Leave granted.
	Heard learned counsel for the parties.
	The Trial Court rejected the prayer for making amendment in the divorce 
petition which has been confirmed by the impugned order.  In the facts and 
circumstances of the case, we are of the view that prayer for amendment should have 
been allowed.
	Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned orders are set aside and the 
prayer for making amendment in the original application is allowed.  The defendant 
may file written statement within two months from today.
