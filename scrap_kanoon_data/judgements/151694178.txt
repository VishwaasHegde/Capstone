Bench: B.N. Agrawal, G.S. Singhvi
                                 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                       CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                         CIVIL APPEAL NO.4801 OF 2008
                     (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.19835 of 2006)



Jason Links (India) Pvt. Ltd.                   ...Appellant(s)


                                       Versus


State Bank of India &amp; Anr.                      ...Respondent(s)




                                    O R D E R

          Heard learned counsel for the parties.
          Leave granted.
          The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission [for short, "the State
Commission"] allowed the complaint and awarded compensation against which order
both the parties filed appeals. The complainant filed First Appeal No.111 of 2006 for
enhancement of compensation; whereas the respondent-Bank filed another appeal
giving rise to First Appeal No.145 of 2006 challenging the order passed by the State
Commission against it. Curiously enough, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission [for short, "the National Commission"], instead of disposing of both the
appeals, which were filed against the common order, dismissed the appeal filed by
                                                                                ...2/-
                                         -2-
the complainant; whereas the appeal filed by the Bank has been admitted and still
pending. In our view, it will be just and expedient to set aside the impugned order
and remit the matter for hearing both the appeals together.
           Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned order is set aside and the
appeal is remitted to the National Commission.         Upon remand, the National
Commission shall hear both the appeals together and decide the same after giving
opportunity of hearing to both the parties.

                                                                    ......................J.
