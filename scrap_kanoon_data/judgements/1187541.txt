WITH
C.A.NO.7868/2001; C.A. NO.7869/2001 &amp; C.A. NO.7870/2001


	These appeals are directed against the judgment and order dated 24/11/2000 passed 
by the Division Bench in DBCWP Nos.1088/2000, 1267/2000, 1276/2000 &amp; 1270/2000.  
Since the question involved in these appeals are identical, we are taking the facts from 
C.A. No.7867/2001.

	We have heard the parties at length.

	Briefly stated, the facts are as follows.

	Pursuant to a tender notice dated 9/2/1999, the appellant made an offer by its letter 
dated 30/3/1999.  The said offer was subject to the following condition:
"CONDITION
	That during the term of Financial Year 1999-2000 
and 2000-2001, if any Liquor/Beer Group in the State of 
Rajasthan

is  granted  any  financial or policy based benefit or benefits 
in exclusive privilege amount, then the same benefit shall, in 
proportionate manner, be given in respect of Kota 
Liquor/Beer Group also."

	The aforesaid offer was provisionally accepted by a letter dated 30/3/1999.  It appears 
that in the letter provisionally accepting the offer there is no mention that condition 
mentioned in the offer letter is rejected.  On the other hand, a close reading of the 
acceptance letter dated 30/3/1999 clearly shows that the offer by the appellant with the 
condition was accepted. In our opinion, the word 'provisionally' in the acceptance letter 
dated 30/3/1999 only means that the offer of the appellant (with the condition) was 
accepted subject to his complying with the formalities mentioned in that letter.  

	It appears that the financial benefits for other Liquor/Beer groups in Rajasthan 
during the financial year 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 was not extended to the appellant.  
Aggrieved thereby, they preferred a writ petition.  

	The High Court was of the view that the condition which was offered and accepted by 
the State does not appear in the licence  and  on  this  sole  ground  the  writ  petition  
was

dismissed.  The finding of the High Court, in our view, is clearly erroneous.  As already 
noted, the appellant's offer with the condition has been accepted by the respondent  
without any demur.  Since the offer has been accepted by the respondent the benefit 
during the financial year 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 was also available to the appellant if 
the same has been granted to any other Liquor/Beer group in the State of Rajasthan.  

	Learned counsel for the respondent strenuously contended that the condition in the 
offer was not accepted by the respondents and, therefore, the appelalnts are not entitled 
for any benefits during those financial years.  We do not agree.  We repeatedly asked the 
counsel for the respondent to show us in the letter of acceptance anywhere where it is 
mentioned that the condition was not accepted.  There is no answer forthcoming to this 
query.  Even otherwise, a reading of the letter of acceptance dated 30/3/1999 does not 
disclose that the conditional offer by the appellant was rejected.  On the contrary, the 
offer was accepted with the condition. Hence, it was a concluded contract under Section 
7 of the Contract Act.

	For the reasons afore-stated, the impugned judgment of the High Court is not tenable 
in law.  It is, accordingly, set aside.  The appeals are allowed.  No costs.
