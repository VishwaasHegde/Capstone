Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.

1.	During the hearing of these appeals reliance was placed 
by the respondents in C.A. No.5481/2002 on a decision of this 
Court in District Mining Officer and Ors.  v. Tata Iron and 
Steel Co. and Anr. (2001 (7) SCC 358). Appellant in the said 
appeal placed reliance on Somaiya Organics (India) Ltd. and 
Anr. v. State of U.P. and Anr. (2001 (5) SCC 519).

2.	High Court in the order impugned relied on District 
Mining Officers case (supra) to hold that though levy upto 
4.4.1991 was permissible, no collection of cess could be made.

3.	In District Mining Officers case (supra) it was, inter-alia, 
observed as follows:

.We do find considerable force in the 
aforesaid submission, as in our view, the 
interpretation we have already given to the 
Validation Act was the real intention of 
Parliament and it never intended to confer a 
right of collection of cess.  In agreement with 
the conclusion arrived at by the Patna High 
Court, we hold the Validation Act to be valid, 
but such validated Acts do not authorize any 
fresh levy or collection in respect of liabilities 
accrued prior to 4.4.1991, though it prohibits 
refund of the collection already made prior to 
that date.

4.	It is to be noted that in the said case the validity of the 
cess and other taxes under the Cess and Other Taxes on 
Minerals (Validation) Act, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as the 
Validation Act) was under consideration.  This Court held 
that the Validation Act did not suffer from any invalidity.  
Having observed so, the aforesaid conclusions were arrived at 
regarding impermissibility for collection not already made.  In 
Somaiya Organics (India)s case (supra) the conceptual 
difference between levy and collect was noted in the 
following words :
29.	Reading the two paras 89 and 90 together 
it does appear that this Court regarded the 
declaration of the provisions being illegal 
prospectively as only meaning that if the 
States had already collected the tax they would 
not be liable to pay back the same. It is the 
States which were protected as a result of the 
declaration for otherwise on the conclusion 
that the impugned Acts lacked legislative 
competence the result would have been that 
any tax collected would have become 
refundable as no State could retain the same 
because levy would be without the authority of 
law and contrary to Article 265 of the 
Constitution. At the same time, it was clearly 
stipulated that the States were restrained from 
enforcing the levy any further. The words used 
in Article 265 are levy and collect. In taxing 
statute the words levy and collect are not 
synonymous terms (refer to CCE v. National 
Tobacco Co. of India Ltd. (1972 (2) SCC 560) at 
p.572), while levy would mean the 
assessment or charging or imposing tax, 
collect in Article 265 would mean the 
physical realisation of the tax which is levied 
or imposed. Collection of tax is normally a 
stage subsequent to the levy of the same. The 
enforcement of levy could only mean 
realisation of the tax imposed or demanded. 
That the States were prevented from recovering 
the tax, if not already realised, in respect of the 
period prior to 25-10-1989 is further evident 
from para 90 of the judgment. The said para 
shows that as on the date of the judgment, for 
the period subsequent to 1-3-1986 the 
demand of the Central Excise Department on 
the alcohol manufactured was over Rs.4 
crores. The Court referred to its orders dated 
1-10-1986  and 16-10-1986 whereby the State 
Government was permitted to collect the levy 
on alcohol manufactured in the Companys 
distilleries. With respect to the said amount of 
Rs.4 crores, it was observed that it is, 
therefore, necessary to declare that in future 
no further realisation will be made in respect 
of this by the State Government from the 
petitioners. The implication clearly was that if 
out of Rs.4 crores the State Government had 
collected some levy the balance outstanding 
cannot be collected after 25-10-1989. 

5.	It appears in District Mining Officers case (supra) this 
Court was of the view that the levy may have been validated 
and that did not authorize collection.  It is to be noted that 
there are different stages in the matter of imposition of tax or 
cess.  First is the source of power for levying tax or cess as the 
case may be.  The second is the actual levy by an adjudication 
or assessment order.  Sometimes, the quantification of the 
amount payable is done in the adjudication/assessment order.  
Finally, comes the question of collection.  That being so, 
collection is a natural corollary of the levy.  It is inconceivable 
that the levy is valid but collection can be held to be 
impermissible.  This is an irreconcilable situation.                 	

6.	We, therefore, find it difficult to agree with the view 
expressed in District Mining Officers case (supra) regarding 
impermissibility of collection in the portion quoted above.  

7.	The matter can be looked from another angle.  Supposing 
somebody has paid the taxes and in other words there has 
been collection of the amount levied.  There may be another  
person who may not have paid it.  The latter person cannot be 
placed at a better footing than the former one.

8.	We, therefore, refer the matter to a larger bench to test 
the correctness of the conclusions that the levy was 
permissible by the Validation Act, but amounts which have 
not already been collected, cannot be collected.  The records 
may be placed before Honble the Chief Justice of India for 
appropriate directions.

9.	Ordered accordingly.
