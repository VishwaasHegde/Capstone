CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.662 OF 2008
(Arising out of S.L.P. (Crl.) No.4879 of 2005)


	Heard learned counsel for the parties.
	Leave granted.
	We have perused the complaint.  In our view, the petition of complaint 
does disclose an offence under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code; as such, the High 
Court was not justified in quashing the prosecution.
	The criminal appeal is, accordingly, allowed and the impugned order is set 
aside.
	The Trial Court shall now proceed with the trial of the case.
