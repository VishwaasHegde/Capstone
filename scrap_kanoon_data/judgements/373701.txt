          Heard learned counsel for the parties.
          Leave granted.
          After the case was heard at great length, learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the respondents made a prayer that, in view of the judgement rendered by
the Allahabad High Court on 18th July, 2008, in Writ Petition No.989 (MB)/1999, the
respondents may be permitted to withdraw Writ Petition No.52563 of 2006, which has
been disposed of by the Allahabad High Court under the impugned order.
          Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has no objection to
the prayer.
          We are not expressing any opinion regarding correctness or otherwise of
the aforesaid order rendered by the Allahabad High Court on 18th July, 2008 in the
writ petition mentioned above. In view of these facts, the appeal is allowed, impugned
order is set aside and Writ Petition No.52563 of 2006 filed by the appellant before
Allahabad High Court is dismissed as withdrawn.
                                                                       ......................J.
