O R D E R 
[Arising out of SLP [C] No. 20598 of 2006] 
TARUN CHATTERJEE,J.
1.	Leave granted.
2.	This order is restricted to an order dated 31st of July, 
2006 passed by a learned Judge of the High Court at 
New Delhi in CRP No. 288 of 2005. We make it clear that 
the learned counsel appearing for the appellant did not 
press the appeal which has also been filed against the 
order dated 31st of July, 2006 in CRP No. 362 of 2004 
and therefore, this appeal stands dismissed in so far as 
regards the order dated 31st of July, 2006 in CRP No. 362 
of 2004.  The impugned order dated 31st of July, 2006 in 
CRP No. 288 of 2005 runs as under: -
Notice.
Notice accepted by Mr. Anupam Srivastava on 
behalf of the respondent.  It was pointed out 
by both the learned counsel that leave to 
defend has already been granted.  The points 
raised in this petition have already been 
raised in the written statement.  The learned 
Judge will consider those objections while 
disposing of the matter.  With these 
observations, the petition is disposed of  	

3.	Having heard the learned counsel for the parties 
and after going through the impugned order as well as the 
order of the trial Court rejecting the application filed under 
Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC, we are of the view that the 
order impugned in this appeal was passed by the High 
Court without applying its mind and without passing a 
reasoned and speaking order. The High Court, in the 
impugned order, had only referred that the points raised 
in the petition under Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC shall be 
decided at the time of disposing of the original suit. That 
being the position, the impugned order cannot stand and 
accordingly, the order dated 31st of July, 2006 in CRP No. 
288 of 2005 is set aside and the CRP No. 288 of 2005 is 
restored to its original file. The High Court is requested to 
decide the Civil Revision case being CRP No. 288 of 
2005 at an early date preferably within three months from 
the date of communication of this order. We make it clear 
that we have not gone into the merits of the order, which 
was challenged by the appellant before the High Court 
rejecting the appellants application under Order 7 Rule 
11 of the CPC.  That will be decided by the High Court in 
accordance with law.      	
4.	The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.  
There will be no order as to costs.
