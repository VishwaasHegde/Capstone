	Leave granted.
	Having heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant and the 
learned Addl. Solicitor General, we are of the opinion that as the appellant is in 
custody for a long time and he is said to be a heart patient and, furthermore, in view 
of the fact that charges have not been framed so far, he shall be released on bail on 
furnishing bail bond for Rs.10,000/- with two sureties each of the same amount, to the 
satisfaction of the Trial Court.
      The appeal is allowed accordingly.
