CIVIL APPEAL NO 1584 OF 2008
[ Arising out of SLP [C] No.2051 of 2007 ]


1.	Delay condoned.
2.	Leave granted.
3.	This appeal is directed against the judgment and order 
dated 22nd of September, 2006 of the High Court of 
Karnataka at Bangalore in MFA No.1741 of 2006, whereby 
the High Court had dismissed the first appeal which was to 
be decided on facts and law.
4.	A suit was filed by the wife  appellant for divorce on 
the ground of cruelty and desertion.  The suit was dismissed 
and a first appeal was carried to the High Court.  By the 
impugned judgment the High Court had dismissed the appeal 
at the admission stage without calling for the records and 
without admitting it.
5.	We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and 
examined the judgments of the High Court as well as of the 
trial court and other materials on record.  In our view the 
High Court had erred in dismissing the first appeal at the 
admission stage itself without issuing notice to the 
respondent and without looking into the evidence and other 
materials on record and also without considering the 
proprietary of the findings made by the trial court.  
Accordingly, the judgment of the High Court is set aside and 
the appeal is remitted back to the High Court for fresh 
determination by passing a reasoned order in accordance with 
law after serving notice on the respondent and taking into 
consideration the entire materials on record including the oral 
and documentary evidence.
6.	For the reasons aforesaid, the appeal is allowed to the 
extent indicated above.  There will be no order as to costs.
