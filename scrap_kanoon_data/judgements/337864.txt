CIVIL APPEAL NO(s). 4959 OF 2001


		Heard learned counsel for the parties.
		This appeal is concluded by the findings of facts rendered by the High 
Court in Second Appeal No.90 of 1975.  We are not inclined to interfere with the 
same.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed.  Interim order, if any, shall stand vacated.  
There will be no order as to costs.
	In view of the order passed in the appeal, the application for impleadment 
stands disposed of as having become infructuous.
