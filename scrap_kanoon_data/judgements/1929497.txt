[Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.8225/2007]

	Leave granted.
	Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the 
dispute between the parties being essentially a matrimonial one and the appellant 
having submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the Investigating Officer in terms of 
the interim order dated 15.1.2008 passed by this Court, interest of justice would be 
subserved if the appellant, in the event of his arrest or surrender, is directed to be 
enlarged on bail on furnishing bail bond for Rs. 10,000/- with two sureties each of the 
like amount, to the satisfaction of the arresting officer and/or the Court concerned, as 
the case may be, subject to the conditions laid down under sub-section (2) of Section 
438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  

				-2-
	This order is being passed as we are of the opinion that in the facts and 
circumstances of this case, custodial interrogation of the appellant is not necessary. 

	It is stated that the contention of respondent No.2 is that the purported receipt in 
question in relation to the return of the request is a forged one. Respondent No.2, if so 
directed by the Investigating Officer, may give her specimen signatures or 
handwriting which may be sent to the Government Examiner for comparison.   

	We, furthermore direct that in the event the Investigating Officer requires the 
appellant to appear before him after giving some time to appear, the appellant shall 
make himself available to him.      
	The appeal is disposed of with the aforementioned observation and direction.
