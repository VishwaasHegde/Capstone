                          CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 3090-3092 OF 2008
                         (Arising out of SLP(C) Nos. 13494-13496/2007)

P.G. SHAJI                                                           ...    APPELLANT(S)
                                           :VERSUS:

AMBIKA AND ANR.                                                      ...   RESPONDENT(S)



                                           ORDER

     1.       Leave granted.

     2.       The auction purchaser is before us aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the

     Orders dated 9.2.2007, 12.2.2007 and 13.3.2007, passed by a learned Single Judge of

     the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in Revision Petition No. 1005/2006. The said

     orders were passed in the revision application filed by the first respondent herein in

     Execution Application No. 685/03 filed in Execution Petition No. 77/99.



     3.       Respondent No.2 filed a suit against the respondent No.1 for specific

     performance of contract.     The said suit was dismissed. On an appeal preferred

     thereagainst, the Court of     II Additional Subordinate Judge, Ernakulam, by its

     judgment and order dated 20th July, 1998 passed in A.S. No.18/98, set aside the

     judgment and decree of the trial Court and allowed the plaintiff-appellant to recover

     a sum of Rs. 50,000/- with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from 26.7.1996 to

     19.7.1998, and 6% interest from 20.7.1998 till the date of realisation. It was directed :
                                             2
         "The appellant/plaintiff is also allowed to to recover the cost for
         the lower court proceedings. The appellant/plaintiff is allowed
         to charge decree amount in the plaint schedule property."

4.          The subject matter of the suit was 5 cents of land. Respondent No.2 -

decree-holder filed the aforementioned execution petition. An application for selling

the said land in auction was filed. An objection thereto was taken by the respondent

No.1 - judgment debtor, contending that for execution of the said decree it was not

necessary to sell the entire 5 cents of land.       Upholding the said contention, the

executing Court directed sale of only 2 cents of land and an off set price was fixed at

Rs. 35,000/-.


5.          Appellant herein, in the auction conducted pursuant to the said direction of

the executing Court, purchased the land in question at the price of Rs. 1,10,000/-. The

Judgment Debtor - Respondent No.2 herein, filed an application in terms of Order 21

Rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), for setting aside the said auction sale.

The same was dismissed by an order dated 20.12.2003.


6.          It is not in dispute that the appellant deposited 25% of the auction amount in

August 2003 and deposited the balance amount on 7th September, 2003.



7.          By reason of the first order dated 9th February, 2007, the High Court

directed:
                                            3
         "Counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is prepared to
         deposit the entire amount due to the auction purchaser before
         12.4.07 and the sale be set aside on that condition so that on failure
         so to do the confirmation of sale ordered by the court below can be
         upheld and the CRP dismissed. It is clearly understood that the
         amount payable to have the sale set aside will take in the bid amount
         deposited by the auction purchaser with interest at 10% thereon
         from the date or dates on which the amount have been deposited till
         date of actual payment, the sale commission and the value of the
         stamp paper produced by the auction purchaser to draft the sale
         deed.
                  Counsel for the petitioner prays for a day's time to consult
         his senior and report as to whether an order on the above lines can
         be agreed to be passed on consent. Delivery in the meanwhile shall
         stand adjourned to 13.2.07."

8.       On the next date fixed, namely, 12.2.2007, the appellant herein expressed his

inability to agree to the said suggestions given by the High Court. By the second order

dated 12 February, 2007, it was directed:


      "It is submitted by the counsel for the second respondent that the
      second respondent/auction purchaser is not amenable for the sale
      being set aside on the terms specified in the order dated 9.2.2007.

      2. Heard the arguments of both sides.

      3. It is seen from the objection filed by the judgment debtor on
      18.10.1999 that the contention of the judgment debtor was that the
      property that is sought to be brought to sale is having value of Rupees
      one lakh per cent and that the total value of the property is Rupees five
                                           4

      lakhs. Despite the said objection, the sale proclamation, on the basis of
      which sale was conducted, which is dated 31.5.2003, shows that the
      estimated price of the property shown by the decree holder for two
      cents of property, from out of the said five cents, that was brought to
      sale, is only Rupees seventy thousand, which works out only to Rupees
      thirty five thousand per cent. When the contention of the judgment
      debtor is that the property is worth Rupees one lakh per cent, that also
      should have been shown as the price, which, according to the judgment
      debtor, will fetch for the property so as to enable the intending
      purchasers to assesses the value and take part in the auction. That has
      not been done in the instant case.

      4. It is contended by the second respondent / auction purchaser that he
      bid the property for a total consideration of Rs. 1,10,000/-, viz., at the
      rate of Rupees fifty five thousand per cent, which is more than the
      estimated price, shown in the sale proclamation. The very fact that the
      auction purchaser himself was prepared to bid in auction at Rs.
      1,10,000/-, when the estimated cost of the property was shown as
      Rupees seventy thousand only in the sale proclamation is suggestive
      that the decree holder has brought the property to sale undervaluing it
      and that is all the more a reason why the property should not have
      been brought to auction without showing the price, as contended by
      the judgment debtor as well in the sale proclamation. The material
      irregularity that has crept in the matter of auction vitiates the sale
      conducted."

9.       A review application was filed thereagaisnt and by reason of the third order

dated 13.3.2007, it was directed:


         "Heard counsel for the review petitioner/auction purchaser, the
                                           5

         counsel for the judgment debtor as also counsel for the decree
         holder.

         2. Counsel for the judgment debtor and the decree holder submit
         that there is no objection to the order being reviewed and the
         request of the petitioner to have the sale set aside on condition
         specified in the order dated 9.2.2007 being brought into effect."

10.      Mr. Deepak, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant would

submit that the High Court manifestly committed an error in passing the

aforementioned orders in so far as it failed to take into consideration that while

setting aside an auction sale, the Court should necessarily arrive at a finding that the

material irregularity and/or fraud or illegality had been committed in the matter of

holding an auction sale and it was furthermore shown that substantial prejudice was

caused to the judgment debtor.


11.      It was also contended that in any view of the matter, having regard to the

provisions contained in Sub-rule 2 of Rule 89 of Order 21 of the CPC, an application

under sub-rule (3) of Rule 90 thereof shall not be maintainable unless and until the

application filed under Order 21 Rule 90 thereof is withdrawn. Learned counsel

appears to be correct.


12.      The first and second impugned orders passed by the High Court did not take

into consideration the aforementioned contentions of the auction purchaser.
                                           6
13.      It is now a well settled principle of law that the Courts while setting aside an

auction sale, must arrive at a finding that illegality and/or irregularity has been

committed in the matter of conduct of auction sale. It must also be held that thereby a

substantial injustice has been caused to the judgment debtor.



14.      In Saheb Khan vs. Mohd. Yusufuddin and Ors., [2006 (4) SCC 476] this

Court held:


                 "Therefore before the sale can be set aside merely establishing
        a material irregularity or fraud will not do. The applicant must go
        further and establish to the satisfaction of the court that the material
        irregularity or fraud has resulted in substantial injury to the applicant.
        Conversely even if the applicant has suffered substantial injury by
        reason of the sale, this would not be sufficient to set the sale aside
        unless substantial injury has been occasioned by a material irregularity
        or fraud in publishing or conducting the sale. (See Dhirendra Nath
        Gorai v. Sudhir Chandra Ghosh, (1994 (6) SCR 1001); Jaswantlal
        Natvarlal Thakkar v. Sushilaben Manilal Dangarwala, (1991 Supp. (2)
        SCC 691) and Kadiyala Rama Rao v. Gutala Kahna Rao, (2000 (3)
        SCC 87)."

15.      In Laxmikant Chhotelal Gupta and Ors. vs. State of Maharashtra and Ors.

[2007 (5) SCC 713], this Court opined:


        "Even when an auction takes place under orders of the competent civil
        court, the procedures laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure are
        required to be complied with. Objections to the validity of sale at the
        instance of one party or the other are required to be considered and
                                          7

        determined. Even an appeal lies against such an order in terms of
        Order 43 Rule 1(u) of the Code of Civil Procedure."

16.      The executing Court in its order dated 20th December, 2003 opined that the

sale of the property effected on 20.8.2003 in favour of the auction purchaser is not

liable to be set aside as no fraud or irregularity has been committed in the matter of

conduct of auction sale. The revisional Court could interfere in the matter provided

the said findings were set aside. By reason of the impugned judgment, the High Court

has not arrived at any such finding. As it appears from the order dated 9.2.2007, the

High Court proceeded to consider the prayer made by respondent No.1 - the

judgment debtor as if it had filed an application in terms of order 21 Rule 89 of the

CPC although it had pressed its objections under Order 21 Rule 90 before the

executing Court.


17.      In the event, however, the High Court intended to grant liberty to the

judgment debtor - respondent No.1 to make such an offer, it was obligatory on its

part to ensure due compliance of the provisions contained under order 21 Rule 89 of

CPC vis-a-vis order 21 Rule 90 of the CPC.


18.      The High Court did not set aside the order passed by the Executing Court.

The High Court without assigning any reason, whatsoever, failed to take into

consideration the condition precedent therefor viz a material irregularity that has

crept in in the matter of auction sale, vitiated the sale conducted. It does not appear
                                            8

that conditions precedent required in terms of the provisions of order 21 Rule 89 of

the CPC were taken into consideration.


19.      Submissions of the learned counsel had not been noticed. The order is not

supported by any reason. No rationality in support thereof is apparent.



20.      Appellant sought for review of the order dated 12.2.2007. While setting

aside the order dated 9.2.2007, it could not have been brought at naught automatically

at the instance of the judgment debtor and decree holder. Appellant herein having

deposited the entire amount in terms of the auction sale held on 20.8.2003, was

entitled to be heard by the High Court before an order of setting aside the auction sale

was passed. We, therefore, are of the opinion that the impugned judgments cannot be

sustained and are to be set aside.


21.      For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgments cannot be

sustained, they are set aside accordingly and the matters are remitted to the High

Court for consideration of the application(s) filed by the aforesaid appellants afresh.



22.      The appeals are disposed of on the above terms. The costs of these appeals

shall abide by the costs of debt portion of the appellant.
