                            CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION


                            CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2867 OF 2008
                            [Arising out of SLP(C) No. 1603/2005]


J &amp; K STATE POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD AND ORS.                         ...    APPELLANT(S)

                                           :VERSUS:

SARDAR JAG MOHAN SINGH                                               ...    RESPONDENT(S)


                                           ORDER

             Leave granted.

             As we thought that this matter may be given a quietus, we directed the

    appellant - Board to find out some alternative plots so that the respondent may start

    his business of stone crushing afresh. An allotment was made to the respondent

    pursuant to the said order. As a grievance was raised that his application for grant of

    electrical connection was not being proceeded with, by an order dated 15.1.2008 this

    Court recorded:

                      "Let the matter appear in April, 2008.
                      In the meantime, the respondent may take possession of the
             plot allotted in this favour and file an application for grant of electrical
             connection within four weeks from date.
                      It is expected that the Power Development Department of the
             State of Jammu and Kashmir shall issue necessary orders granting
             electrical connection in favour of the respondent in the meantime."

                                                    -2-
         Despite the said order, no step appears to have been taken by the respondent

to take possession of the alternative plot allotted to him and apply for grant of

electrical connection. We have granted an opportunity to the learned counsel to seek

instructions from the respondent. Learned counsel for the respondent states that no

instruction has been received by her. In this view of the matter, it is not possible for us

to grant any further adjournment as it appears that the respondent is not interested in

the matter.

         For the reasons aforementioned, this appeal is allowed and the impugned

judgment is set aside. No costs.
