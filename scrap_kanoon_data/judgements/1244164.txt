JUDGMENT
O R D E R

1.	Heard learned counsel for the parties.

2.	In our view, this appeal is now concluded by the 
concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the High Court as well 
as by the tribunals below on the question whether the 
appellants were liable to pay batai or chakota under the 
Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953. After going 
through the judgment of the High Court as well as of the 
tribunals below, we do not find any infirmity in the said 
concurrent findings of fact recorded by the courts below. 
Accordingly, we are not inclined to interfere with the order 
passed by the High Court and the tribunals below. 
3.	However, we direct that the appellants shall deliver 
peaceful vacant possession to the respondent by                 
31st of May, 2008 after filing usual undertaking within a 
fortnight from this date. 
4.	The appeal is thus dismissed. There will be no order as to 
costs.
