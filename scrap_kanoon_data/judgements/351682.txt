O R D E R 

1.	Appellant Manickam along with two other accused  Palani and Oomaiyan @ Mani 
was tried for the offences under Sections 449/324/302/109 of Indian Penal Code ( in 
short IPC) on the allegation that on 26.12.1993 at about      8.00 a.m. in 
Vizhududaiyan Village, appellant along with accused  Palani and Oomaiyan  
trespassed into the house of Anbalagan, caused simple injuries on the person of 
Alamelu (PW 4) and Anjalai (PW 5) and committed the murder of Anbalagan.   

2.	The Sessions Judge, Tiruchirappalli, by his judgment dated 8.10.1996 acquitted the 
appellant and the other accused persons.  Challenging the said judgment of the 
Sessions Judge, the State filed an appeal before the High Court.  The High Court by 
its impugned judgment dated 21.7.2006 acquitted accused Palani and Oomaiyan but 
set aside the judgment in respect of appellant-accused and held him guilty under 
Section 304 (Part-II) IPC and sentenced him to undergo R.I. for 5 years.

3.	Aggrieved by the impugned judgment of the High Court, the appellant has 
preferred the present appeal by special leave.

4.	We have heard learned senior counsel for the parties and have perused the evidence 
on record.  PW 4 Alamelu, the wife of Anbalagan (since deceased) and  PW 5 Anjalai, 
who also sustained injuries in the incident,  have supported the prosecution case 
coupled with the statement of appellant-accused recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C.  
On consideration of the aforesaid evidence, we do not find any infirmity in the 
impugned judgment of the High Court.  However, considering  the facts that the 
appellant-accused is an old person aged about 77 years, the incident is of the year 
1993, the appellant-accused was convicted for exceeding the right of private defence 
and he has already undergone sentence for more than 1= years, the ends of justice will 
be served if he is sentenced to the period already undergone by him.  We order 
accordingly.  The appellant-accused be set at liberty if he is not required in any other 
case.
4.	The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
