	Leave 	granted.

	Challenging an interim order passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in RSA 
No. 3190 of 2004, this appeal has been filed.  The suit of the respondent was dismissed 
by the trial Court but the first appellate Court decreed it.  The Second Appeal has 
been filed by the present appellants.  

	By the impugned order, the learned Single Judge directed the stay of the direction for 
payment of arrears of scale Rs.950-Rs.1050 granted by the learned Additional District 
Judge. But from the date of judgment, i.e., from April, 2004, it was directed that the 
respondent (wrongly stated as appellant) would be granted salary in the  scale of  Rs. 
950-1500/-.  The  C.Ms. were disposed of.  Operation of the order has been stayed by 
this Court.  

	Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that  reading of one of the lines in the 
order, i.e.,"The question of arrears would be determined in this RSA" creates 
confusion as to whether only that question  has to be gone into.  That does not appear 
to be the tenure of the order.  We request the High Court to dispose of the Second 
Appeal as early as
..2/-

 : 2 :
practicable.  Till disposal of the Second Appeal, the interim order of stay passed by 
this Court on 20th April, 2007 shall continue to be operative.    We make it clear that 
by making this direction, it shall not be construed that we have expressed any opinion 
on the merits of the matter.

	The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of.

	No costs.
