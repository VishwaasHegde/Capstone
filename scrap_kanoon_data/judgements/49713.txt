	CIVIL APPEAL NO.871    OF 2008
           [Arising out of SLP(C)No.1683 of 2006]
    
	Leave granted.
      	Heard the parties at length.
	In appeal preferred by Union of India before the District Judge, it is alleged that 
there was a delay of 447/523 days.   The District Judge after considering the facts and circumstances 
supported by elaborate reasons condoned the delay.  The High Court, however, in revision application 
filed under Section 115 of C.P.C. interfered with the order of the District Judge and reversed the 
decision.
	It is now settled law that condonation of delay is the discretionary power of the 
Court.  If the Court of the first instance exercises the discretionary power and has condoned the delay 
or refused to condone the delay, the appellate court normally does not interfere.   In the present case, 
the District Judge has condoned the delay after taking into consideration the facts and circumstance 
recited in the condonation application supported by reasons,  allowed 


						-2-
Section 5 of the Limitation application.  The High Court should have restrained in such matters to 
interfere with the discretionary power of the court of the first instance.
	We accordingly, set aside the order of the High Court.   The order passed by the 
District Judge is restored.  The appeal now is restored to the file of District Judge,  for disposal   on 
merit and in accordance with law.   The appeal may be expedited. 
	The appeal is disposed of.
