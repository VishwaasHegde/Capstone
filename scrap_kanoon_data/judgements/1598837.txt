O R D E R	
CIVIL APPEAL NO.  6589-6598   OF 2002

	Heard.
	These appeals are directed against the judgment and order of the Kerala 
High Court dated 17.1.2002.
	In view of the judgment passed by this Court in the case of Union of India 
and Another vs. R.Swami Nathan &amp; Others reported in 1997 (7) SCC 690 
the order of the High Court is set aside.
	  The problem, however, subsists because against the order of the 
Tribunal dated 29.10.1993 passed in O.A.No. 1134/1993, the special leave 
petition No. ...CC. 2293/1995 was dismissed in limine by the two Judge 
Bench of this Court on 8.5.1995.  The special leave petition was dismissed 
by a non-speaking order.  In that view of the matter the judgment rendered 
by the Tribunal attains finality.  We are of the view that the subsequent 
judgment delivered by three Judge Bench of this Court in R.Swaminathan 
case (supra) on the same question of law will prevail because it is 
supported with reasons.
	  In these circumstances we allow the appellant to file a review petition 
before the Tribunal for review of its order dated 29.10.93.  If the review 
petition is filed within six weeks from today, the Tribunal shall entertain 
the review petition without raising any objection of limitation.  The 
appellant shall necessarily produce before 




-2-

the Tribunal the judgment of the three Judge Bench of this Court rendered 
in R.Swaminathan and Others (supra).  On considering of the aforesaid 
judgment the Tribunal may pass an appropriate order in accordance with 
law.  The Tribunal is directed to decide the review petition within three 
months from the date of the filing of the review petition.

	The appeals are disposed of.
