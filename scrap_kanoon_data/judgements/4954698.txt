          Jaswant Kumar Vyas                                         ...Appellant
          Versus
          Krishna Dev Sharma                                       ...Respondent


                                          ORDER
1.   Delay condoned.

          2.    Leave granted.

          3.    This appeal is filed by way of a special leave petition against the

          final judgment and order of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at

          Hyderabad dated 25th of October, 2007 in Second Appeal No. 539 of

          2006 whereby a learned Judge of the High Court had dismissed the

          second appeal filed by the appellant and affirmed the orders of the

          courts below.

          4.    A suit for eviction of the appellant from the suit premises was

          instituted by the plaintiff/respondent which was decreed by the trial

          court and the decision of the trial court was affirmed by the first

          appellate court and finally, the second appeal of the appellant was


                                                                        1
                                                                          2


dismissed. Before the High court in the second appeal, the only question

that was raised was whether in the present case, notice under Section

106 of the Transfer of Property Act should be restricted to 6 months or

1 month. All the three courts below held that tenancy was from month

to month and accordingly, the second appeal was dismissed and the

orders of the courts below were affirmed. This special leave petition has

now been filed against the aforesaid judgment in second appeal

affirming the judgments of the courts below in respect of which leave

has already been granted.

5.    Mr. A. Subba Rao, the learned counsel appearing for the

appellant restricted his arguments to the order passed by the learned

single Judge, which is as follows: -


        "Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the
        appellant is granted time up to the end of May 2008, on
        condition that he furnishes an undertaking before the trial court,
        within four weeks from today, to the effect that he will put the
        respondent herein in vacant possession and continues to pay the
        rents regularly. In default, apart from being liable to be evicted,
        the appellant shall be liable to pay the damages at the rate of
        Rs. 10,000/- per month beyond 31.05.2008."

                                                                          2
                                                              3
6.      According to Mr. Rao, the High Court was in error to direct the

appellant to pay damages at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month if the

appellant continues to remain in possession of the suit premises after

31st of May, 2008 which was granted by the High Court in the impugned

judgment. Mr. Nikilesh Ramachandran, learned counsel appearing for

the respondent, conceded that this direction of the High Court was in

fact not justified.   Considering the fact that proceedings for mesne

profit under Order 20 Rule 12 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall be

proceeded with in accordance with law and in view of the concession of

learned counsel for the respondent, direction to pay damages at the rate

of Rs.10,000/- per month, if the appellant continues to remain in

possession after 31st of May, 2008 must be set aside. Therefore, we set

aside the portion to the effect that the appellant shall be liable to pay

damages at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month if he continues to remain

in possession of the suit premises after 31st of May, 2008.



7. For the reasons aforesaid the appeal is disposed of by deleting the

     portion as quoted hereinabove. However, the appellant is granted



                                                              3
                                                               4


  nine months time from today to vacate the suit premises on payment

  of Rs.2,000/- per month subject to filing of usual undertaking in this

  Court within a period of four weeks from this date.
