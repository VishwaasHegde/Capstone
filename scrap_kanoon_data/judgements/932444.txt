TRANSFER PETITION(C) NO.271 OF 2007

	This is a wife's petition to transfer the Divorce Petition from Agra to Delhi. The 
ground taken in this petition is that the wife-petitioner's father is suffering from 
cancer. This ground is also taken that she is having  three years old daughter 
studying in Ryan Public International School, Faridabad, therefore, she will not be 
able to go to Agra  from Delhi to contest the suit. 	
	The respondent was served but declined to accept the notice. Enough 
opportunity is given to him but he has chosen not to appear.
	Considering the above facts, we allow the transfer petition. Accordingly, 
Divorce Petition in Suit No.106 of 2006 titled as Shri Chandra Pratap Singh vs. Smt. 
Divya pending before the Court of Family Judge, Agra, Uttar Pradesh is transferred 
to the Court of District Judge, Delhi, who shall hear the suit himself or assign it to 
any other Judge competent to try  such case.
