                                     O R D E R

           These appeals involving common questions of law and fact are directed
against an order dated 29.11.2004 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of
judicature at Patna in several Letters Patent Appeals affirming interim orders passed
by the learned Single Judge of the said Court releasing Kendu Leaves seized from the
respondents on the premise that the same being perishable in nature and as 70% of
the amount had already been paid by the purchaser to the Panchayats the goods may
be released subject to deposit of the rest 30% of the price.
           The Division Bench noticed as under:

            " Learned counsel for the appellants after argument says that if it is
decided that the leaves were collected from the reserve forest then in such a situation
the State will be at a loss. The submission of the learned counsel appears to be not
tenable because if any order is passed that is always subject to final adjudication of
the case. However, we make it clear that the entire deposit i.e. 100% of the
consideration money by the purchasers would be subject to result of the writ
petitions."
           Before we embark upon the contentions raised before us, we may notice
that this Court by an order dated 7.1.2005
                                           -1-




while granting 'Leave' in certain matters directed as under:
           " Learned counsel for the respondent auction purchasers submit that they
have deposited the entire 100 per cent consideration amount, therefore, pray for
immediate release of the goods. If that be so, the forest produce, in question, shall be
released with necessary transit permits within three days from today."
           The said order, however, was further clarified by this Court in its order
dated 11.1.2005 which is to the following effect:
           " In our order dated 7.1.2005 inadvertently following further directions
were not transcribed. Therefore, after hearing the parties, we think it appropriate
that the following directions also be included in addition to the directions already
issued on 7.1.2005.

         In the event of State succeeding in the appeal, the State will be entitled for
compensation that may be fixed by this Court at the time of final disposal.

            If the Court ultimately finds that the sale consideration does not reflect the
true price, the auction purchasers would have to pay the difference. At the same time
if the respondents succeed and if the Court deciding the appeal finally considers it
appropriate then the respondents will be entitled to damages, if any, suffered by
virtue of the delayed delivery of the forest produce.

           The above directions shall be included in our order dated 7.1.2005 as part
of the same."
           Indisputably, the aforementioned orders have been carried out.
           Certain basic facts are, furthermore, not in dispute.
           The State of Bihar by resolution dated 23.10.2003 in exercise of its power
under Article 243(G) of the Constitution of India delegated its power in favour of
Gram Panchayats opining that the Gram Panchayats are responsible for plantation,
maintenance of plants of minor forest produce, extension work and training
programmers for improvement of the economic states of the villagers.
                                           -2-
           It was further stated:

           " This delegation of power is not valid for sanctuary and national parks."

           Learned counsel appearing on behalf of State of Bihar contends before us
that the Central Empowered Committee constituted by this Court in the case of T.N.
Godavarman Thirumalpad Vs. Union of India(C.A.No.202/1995) directed that the
prohibited activities as specified therein which included collection of minor forest
produce should not be allowed to be undertaken in the protected areas which,
indisputably, includes National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries.
          We would place on record the Chart produced by the learned Counsel to
show the factual matrix involving these Civil Appeals. It reads as under:

           On an allegation that the respondents herein got Kendu leaves collected
from the Kaimur Wild Life Sanctuary, raids were conducted by the Forest Range
Officer and   different quantities of MFP-Kendu Leaves were seized. Intimation,
thereabout, was also given to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kaimur in terms of
Section 52 of the Indian Forest Act.
           The Chief Wildlife Warden also made inspection and submitted its report
in regard thereto.
           An application was filed by the Divisional Forest Officer, Kaimur in the
Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate to allow the auction of the perishable goods. The
same was challenged in the writ petition by the respondents herein, wherein, as
noticed hereinbefore interim orders came to be passed by the learned Single Judge as
also the Division Bench of the Patna High Court.
           The learned counsel for the respondents,however, contends that the
Panchyati Raj institutions keeping in view the provisions of Article 243 (G) read with
Entry 7 of the XIth Schedule of the Constitution of India as also in view of the
abovesaid resolution dated 23.10.2007 issued by the State of Bihar, are entitled to
collect minor forest produce.
           It has been disputed that the collection of Kendue leaves had been effected
                       from the Kaimur Wildlife Sanctuary -4-

as alleged by the forest authorities. It was furthermore contended that the Mukhiyas
of the respective villages are not being prosecuted as also the collections have been
made upon obtaining all necessary permissions.
           The impugned orders are interim ones. The question as to whether the
authorities of the Forest department of the State of Bihar were legally empowered to
carry out the searches and seizures in the teeth of the aforementioned resolution
dated 23.10.2003 is a question which requires determination of the appropriate
authority. Some disputed questions of fact are also involved in the writ petition filed
by the concerned respondents herein which are pending decision before a learned
Single Judge of the Patna High Court. The said writ petitions, we are informed at the
Bar, are running on the daily board.
           In this view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the interest of justice
would be subserved if the interim orders passed by this Court Court are made
absolute subject of course to the ultimate decision of the Patna High Court in the
aforementioned writ petition.
           We would, however, keeping in view the fact that as the question involved
is an important one request the High Court to consider the desirability of disposing of
the matter as expeditiously as possible and preferably within a period of three
months from the date of communication of this order.
           The appeals are disposed of accordingly. No costs.

                                                                        ......................J.
