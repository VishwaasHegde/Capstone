	Heard learned counsel for the parties.

	Mr. C.A. Sundaram, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant(s) fairly 
submits that he has given up all other contentions except that the appellant is willing to 
pay the electricity charges as per clause (1) of the Board's order D.O. No. 
Plg.Cost.902/PC/86 dated 14/10/1988.  Mr. T.L.V. Iyer, learned senior counsel 
appearing on behalf of the respondent, however, brought to our notice clause (5) of the 
said order which stipulates that the special allocation of power over and above the quota 
during power cut period will be charged at 80 paise per unit, the rate applicable for 
imported energy.  Since the power cut has admittedly been lifted on 14/8/1986 and in 
view of clear order of the board in clause(1)
.....2.

	2 -

of the order, we are of the view that clause (5) of the order is not attracted in these cases 
and, therefore, the appellant(s) are covered by clause (1) of the Board's order.  

	Accordingly, we direct that the appellant(s) shall be charged electricity charges in 
terms of clause (1) of the Board's order D.O. No. Plg.Cost.902/PC/86 dated 14/10/1988 
in the ratio 25:75 on the actual consumption.  This would be in consonance with the 
Board's order.  

	Appeals are disposed of in the above terms.
