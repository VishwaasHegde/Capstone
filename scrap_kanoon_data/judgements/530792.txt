		Having heard learned counsel for the parties,as we are of the opinion 
that for establishing their claim that they were entitled for  wages for working on 
Saturdays and Sundays, the workmen must establish their legal right in the proceedings 
under Section 33-(C)(2) of the Industrial  Disputes Act,1947 wherefor they had been 
granted liberty to move the  appropriate Labour Court in this behalf by this Court in 
Municipal Employees Union(Regd) Sirhind &amp; Ors. Vs. State of Punjab and Ors. - 
(2000) 9 SCC 432, the impugned judgment would not come on the way of the 
appellants herein in raising all contentions before the Labour Court if and when such 
applications are filed.
	In this view of the matter, we are of the opinion that it is not necessary for us 
to interfere with the impugned judgment at this stage.  We may notice that in Civil 
Appeal 
	
				-1-


No. 5873 of 2006  disposed of on 15.12.2006, this Court observed as under:
    	" An application under Section 33-C(2) would be maintainable if the workmen 
has a legal right in relation to his claim. They will have to establish the same. In such a 
proceeding, undisputedly the appellants shall be entitled to raise all contentions before 
the Industrial Court. We, therefore, do not find any merit in these appeals.The appeals 
are dismissed."
	For the reasons stated hereinbefore, these appeals are disposed of.
C. A. No.1155/2003,C.A.1370/2008@ SLP(C)Nos.21642/2003, C.A.1372/2008(@ 
SLP(C) No.21644/2003)
	
	Leave granted in special leave petitions.
	Appellant which is a 'State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the 
Constitution of India very fairly did not deny or dispute the legal rights of the 
respondents-workmen. The High Court in its impugned judgment has held as under:

	"...The claim of the petitioner is hardly disputed in the written statement so as 
to make them entitled to receive the said payment.

	In view of the circumstances afore-noticed, we dispose of this petition with a 
direction to the respondents to pass appropriate orders computing the amount due to 
the petitioners in the light of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court (supra) and pay 
the same within a period of three months from today."

	In its written statement before the High Court, the appellant  while admitting 
the legal right of the workmen has categorically stated that they were not in position to 
discharge their financial liability owing to financial  constraints as octroi has been 
withdrawn. The High Court in 

				-2-

the  impugned judgment has noticed  that now octroi is again being levied and in that 
view  of the matter issued the impugned directions. 
	Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant when confronted with 
the said position does not dispute the liability of the appellant.
	In that view of the  matter, we are of the opinion that it is not a fit case where 
we should exercise our discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution 
of India.

	The appeals are dismissed.
