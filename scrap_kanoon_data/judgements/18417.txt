O R D E R
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 618 OF 2008
[Arising out of SLP(C) No.18101/2006]

	Leave granted. 

	Heard learned counsel for the appellant at great length.  We see no reason to interfere 
with the well-merited concurrent findings of facts recorded by the three Courts below.  
The appeal, being devoid of merit, is, accordingly, dismissed.  The time for vacating is, 
however, extended by six months from today on an usual undertaking to be filed by the 
appellant within four weeks.
