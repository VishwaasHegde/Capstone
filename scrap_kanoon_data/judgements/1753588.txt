            IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
            CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

            CIVIL APPEAL NO.4889 OF 2002


Buddha Tri-Ratna Mission                             ...Appellant

VERSUS

Delhi Development Authority &amp; Ors. ...Respondents


                       O R D E R

1.   This    appeal       is    preferred        against       the

judgment     and   order       dated    22nd    of   May,     2000

passed by a Division Bench of the High Court

of   Delhi        in   LPA      NO.226         and   CM       Nos.

846-848/2000.

2.   We have heard the learned counsel for the

parties     and    also    examined       the    order        under

appeal. While dismissing the appeal in limine,

the Division Bench of the High Court was not

in a position to accept the submission of the

learned     counsel    for     the     appellant      that      the

appellant need not be entirely a charitable

institution. It was rightly pointed out by the

Division Bench that the learned Single Judge

of    the    Delhi     High    Court      did   not    rightly

consider the cases in the context of Section

115 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act as

relevant.      As     according      to    them,      the        said

provision was totally different and in this

view of the matter, the LPA was dismissed.

However,      after     dismissing        the   appeal,          the

Division Bench had further issued a notice to

the   Land    and     Development      Officer     and          Delhi

Development Authority which was confined to

the aspect of deposit of balance amount. It

appears from the said order that a sum of

Rs.10,50,000/- was already deposited as per

direction of the High Court and accordingly

there was a stay of cancellation of allotment

of land in favour of the appellant. It was

further directed that till the next date of

hearing, the respondent would not cancel the

allotment      of     the     land   in    favour      of        the

appellant. After the leave was granted on 9th
                                                             3


of August, 2002, this Court directed, as an

interim       measure,        the     parties     to     maintain

status quo till the disposal of the appeal.

This    interim      order     of     status     quo    is       still

continuing.

3.     After    hearing       learned         counsel    for       the

parties and after considering the fact that

Rs.10,50,000/-          had     been      deposited      as        per

direction of the Delhi High Court and that the

status quo order was granted by this Court in

the year 2002, we only direct that if the

appellant deposits the balance amount, if not

already deposited in the High Court, within

two months from the date of supply of a copy

of     this    order,    the        respondents        shall       not

cancel    the     allotment         of   the     land    made       in

favour of the appellant if cancellation of the

allotment       of   the       land      in    favour    of        the

appellant has not already been done by the

Delhi Development Authority and others.
                                                                   4
4.    With   these   observations,         we        dispose                 of

the   appeal.   There   will   be     no        order              as        to

costs.
