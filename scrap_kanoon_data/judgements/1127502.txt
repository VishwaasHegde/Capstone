 CIVIL APPEAL NO.4032 OF 2002


	
In this appeal, the appellant  M/s. Pennar 
Paterson Ltd. calls in question whether the 
expression "other legal proceedings" occurring in 
Section 446(1) of the Companies Act, 1956 includes 
criminal proceedings or not. The High Court by the 
impugned order has held that it does not, relying 
on a decision of this Court in the case of M/s. BSI 
Ltd. &amp; Anr. vs. Gift Holdings Pvt. Ltd.&amp; Anr. Etc. 
[AIR 2000 SC 926].  The question involved in this 
appeal is also covered by the aforesaid decision 
relied on by the High Court. We do not find any 
merit in this appeal. The learned counsel appearing 
for the appellant also could not satisfy us nor 
could he distinguish the decision relied on by the 
High Court. Since the question is covered by the 
aforesaid decision of this Court, we do not find 
any merit in this appeal. Accordingly the appeal is 
dismissed with no order as to costs.
