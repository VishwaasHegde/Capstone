JUDGMENT

	Delay condoned. Appeal admitted.	
	Mr. Ajay Aggarwal, learned counsel, accepts notice for the respondent.

	The short question which arises in the present case is: Whether `Vipul 
Booster' is an insecticide  or whether it is a plant growth regularor?

	We have gone through the judgment of the Tribunal.  It has been pointed 
out on behalf of the Department, rightly, that the assessee has registered 
the above-mentioned product as insecticide with the Directorate of Plant 
Protection, Ministry of Agriculture, Faridabad and that they have been 
regularly following all procedures and formalities stipulated under the 
Insecticide Act, 1968. This aspect has not at all been considered by the 
Tribunal. The Tribunal has also failed to consider the effect of the 




-2-

issuance of such a certificate under the Insecticide Act, 1968.  It is argued 
on behalf of the assessee that one of the ingredients of the above product 
is insecticide and the certificate issued under the Insecticide Act is only 
with reference to that ingredient only. All these questions will require 
fresh consideration in accordance with law by the Tribunal.

	Accordingly, the impugned judgment is set aside and the matter is 
remitted to the Tribunal for fresh consideration in accordance with law.

	Appeal is disposed of.
