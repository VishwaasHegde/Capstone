                     O R D E R

1.   Since    Mr.Brajesh     Kumar       and    Mr.Ajay

Kumar    Talesara,    Advocates       have      entered

appearance    on   behalf    of    the    respondent,

service of notice is, therefore, complete.



2.   This is an application for transfer of

Matrimonial    (T.S.)       Case    No.1       of    2006

titled   Dharmendra     Kumar      Gupta       vs.   Arti

Devi @ Pinki Devi &amp; Anr., pending in the

Court    of    District      Judge,        Palamu     at

Daltanganj, within the State of Jharkhand,

to the Family Court at Patna, within the

State of Bihar.
                                                               2
3.     Having heard the learned counsel for

the    parties     and        after         considering        the

materials         on         record          including         the

statements      made         in   the       application        for

transfer, we are of the view that since

the petitioner is a lady having a minor

male child, it would be difficult for her

to attend the court at Palamu, Daltanganj

which is within the State of Jharkhand and

quite a distance from Patna where she is

now residing with her child, we allow this

application            for        transfer              and    the

proceedings now pending being Matrimonial

(T.S.) Case No.1 of 2006 in the Court of

District       Judge,         Palamu             at    Daltanganj

within      the        State           of        Jharkhand      be

transferred to the Family Court of Patna

within the State of Bihar. The District

Judge, Palamu at Daltanganj is directed to

send     the      records          of        the        aforesaid

matrimonial        case           at        an        early   date

preferably within six weeks from the date
                                                                         3


of supply of a copy of this order to him.

The   application     for    transfer                    is          thus

allowed.   There    will    be      no       order              as        to

costs.
