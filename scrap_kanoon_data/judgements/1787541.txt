				O R D E R
	CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.  214  OF 2008
[Arising out of SLP(Crl.)No.6860 of 2006]


	Leave granted.
	In this appeal, the brother of the deceased has prayed for cancellation of the bail granted 
to respondent No.1 Allauddin, despite his conviction under Sections 147, 148, 302/149 of the 
Indian Penal Code and Sections 25/27 of the Arms Act.
	The manner in which the deceased was killed and the other facts as revealed, in our view, 
did not warrant release of the respondent No.1 on bail while the appeal was pending before 
the High Court.  

				-2-
	Having heard learned counsel for the respective parties, we, therefore, cancel the bail 
granted to the respondent No.1 and direct that he be taken into custody forthwith.
	Having regard to the fact that the respondent No.1 has already  undergone seven years' 
imprisonment, we also request the High Court to dispose of the pending appeal 
expeditiously.
	The appeal stands allowed.
