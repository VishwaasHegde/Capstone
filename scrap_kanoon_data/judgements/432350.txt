 CIVIL APPEAL NO.412  OF 2008
(SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (C) NO.1284 OF 2007)

	Leave granted.
	Heard the parties.
	By the order impugned the High Court dismissed the Arbitration Application 
invoking the arbitration clause as barred by limitation. We have been taken through 
the High Court order.  The undisputed fact is that although the work stood 
completed sometime in 1999-2000 the correspondences were made between the 
parties with regard to the settlement of bills. The correspondences made between the 
parties are  letters dated 21.01.2003, 11.04.2003 and 24.04.2003.  Unfortunately, the 
High Court has failed to take note of these correspondences but dismissed 
application invoking arbitration clause as barred by limitation.

			: 2 :
	We are of the clear view that the High Court was in error in not considering 
these correspondences between the parties.  The order of the High Court is 
accordingly set aside.  The Arbitration Application No.16 of 2006 is restored to the 
file of the High Court for afresh disposal by taking into account the correspondences 
made between the parties vide letters dated 21.01.2003, 11.04.2003 and 24.04.2003.  
Since, the matter is pending for quite some time, the High Court is requested to 
dispose of the said Arbitration Application as expeditiously as possible preferably 
within three months from the date of receipt of this order.
	The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
