		Delay condoned.

		Leave granted.

		When the matter was called out, learned Additional Solicitor 
General placed before us a copy of the order passed by a Bench of this Court in 
Commr. of Income Tax,Shimla Vs. M/s Sirmour Truck Operators Union, Gondpr  
Civil Appeal No. 5845/2007 stating as under:

		" Delay condoned. Leave granted.

		M/s Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd. entered into a contract with M/s 
Sirmour Truck Operators Union, the respondent herein. Respondent assessee is a 
society. Its members consist of truck operators. The question which arose before the 
High Court in the Income Tax Appeals under Section 260A was whether assessee was 
liable or not liable to deduct TDS under Section 194 C of the Income Tax Act.

-1-
		In our view, the afore-stated question is a substantial question of 
law. The High Court ought to have decided the said question. It ought not to have 
dismissed the appeals summarily.

		For the afore-stated reasons, we set aside the impugned order and 
remit the matters to the High Court for consideration in accordance with law.

		The appeals are disposed of accordingly. No order as to costs."

		Following the said decision, we set aside the impugned judgment 
and remit the matter to the High Court for consideration of the matter afresh in 
accordance with law.

		The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
