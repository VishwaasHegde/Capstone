CIVIL APPEAL NO(s).1354 OF 2008
(@ SLP(C)NO.12823/2006)


		Leave granted.
		This is an appeal from an order dated 23rd of November, 2005 passed by the 
High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, Nagpur, rejecting an 
application for condonation of delay of 11 days in filing the appeal.
		Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after going through the 
statements made in the application for condonation of delay, we are satisfied with 
the statements made in the application for condonation of delay which constitute 
sufficient cause for condoning the delay in filing the appeal.  We, therefore, set aside 
the impugned order  rejecting  the  application for condonation of delay.

::2::
Accordingly the application for condonation of delay is allowed.  The Appeal is 
restored to its original file.  The High Court is now requested to dispose of the 
appeal at an early date, preferably within three months from the date of 
communication of this order to the High Court, without granting any unnecessary 
adjournment to either of the parties.

		The Appeal is allowed accordingly with no order as to costs.
