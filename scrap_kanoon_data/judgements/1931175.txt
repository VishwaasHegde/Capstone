O R D E R
TRANSFER PETITION(C)  NO. 1015 OF 2006

	This transfer petition is filed by the wife.  Several adjournments were granted to 
enable the parties to come to a settlement.  Counsel on both the sides appear today and 
state that amicable settlement out of the court has become impossible.
	The ground taken for transfer in this petition is that Section 498A petition filed by 
the petitioning wife is pending in the Court of the Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate, 
Bermo, Tenughat in Jharkhand.  It is stated that in any event the respondent-husband 
has to go to Jharkhand and contest the petition filed under Section 498A.  In our view, 
this is sufficient ground for transfer.
	Accordingly, Matrimonial Suit No.165/2006 namely Sarat Chandra Mishra Vs. Smt 
Swapna Mishra @ Goswami pending in the Court of the Learned District Judge, 
Burdwan, West Bengal stands transferred to the Court of Principal Judge, Family 
Court, Bokaro, Jharkhand.
	Transfer petition is allowed.
