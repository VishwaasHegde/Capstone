O R D E R	
	
	Being aggrieved by the denial of refund claim made by the assessee the 
appellant has come to this Court by way of special leave petition.

	The short question which arose before the Tribunal was whether the 
assessee had passed on the duty burden to its customers. Burden was on 
the assessee to show compliance of section 12B of the Central Excise Act 
1944.

	  In this case the Department had referred the matter to the Assistant 
Director to examine the cost construction method adopted by the 
assessee.  The Assistant Director has given its report based on weighted 
average cost as the assessee has failed to furnish the exact cost 
attributable to the various components of the final product manufactured 
by the assessee namely PCTR. The said report has   been   accepted  by  
the   Tribunal.   We   find  no

infirmity in the impugned judgment of the Tribunal. The assessee has 
failed to discharge the burden placed on it under Sec.12B.  Accordingly 
the civil appeals is dismissed with no order as to costs.
