CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.  577 OF 2008
(Arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 7463/2007)


Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.

1.	Leave granted.

2.	Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a learned 
single judge of the High Court upholding the judgment of learned 
Principal Sessions Judge, Shimoga in SC No.37 of 1995 
convicting the three appellants for offence punishable under 
Section 326 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the 'IPC') 
and sentence each one of them to undergo rigorous 
imprisonment for five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2,000/- each 
with default stipulation. There were originally 14 accused 
persons.  The trial court found the present appellants guilty and 
others were found not to be guilty under Section 235(1) of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the 'Cr.P.C.').  
Originally all the accused persons were charged for having 
committed offence under Sections 143,144,147, 148, 109, 504, 
324, 323 and 506 read with Section 149 IPC.  In view of death of 
Mahadevappa (hereinafter referred to as 'deceased') on 
28.11.1994, Section 302 IPC was added. 

3.	The prosecution version as unfolded during trial was as 
follows:

The accused persons 1 to 14 forming themselves into 
members of unlawful assembly, with deadly weapons assaulted 
CW-1 and caused fracture of his left leg.  CW-1 consequent to the 
injuries and septicemia died after five days while under 
treatment.  The F.I.R. is lodged by the deceased.  The contents of 
the F.I.R. implicated all the accused persons. PWs. 2 and 5 are 
the eye witnesses to the incident.  They also implicate A1 to A-14 
as assailants who caused grievous injuries on CW-1, ultimately 
resulting in his death.

4.	As noted above, after the death of the deceased, another 
complaint was filed and the case was registered as one in relation 
to the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.  The trial court 
as noted above found accused 4 to 14 to be not guilty.  An appeal 
was preferred by the appellants which, as noted above was 
dismissed.  The High Court disposed of the appeal observing as 
follows:

"The trial court has grossly erred in 
acquitting A4 to A14.  Since Section 149 is 
invoked and acquitted accused would be 
equally and vicariously liable for the acts of 
A1 to A3 as they have shared  common object 
and they had also participated in the assault.  
The State has not filed an appeal against 
illegal acquittal.

The trial court convicted A1 to A3 for 
committing offence under Section 326  I.P.C.  
The injury was caused on the non-vital part, 
no intention to cause the injury which is 
likely to cause death and no knowledge of 
causing death could be inferred from the 
overt acts.  Therefore conviction u/s 326 IPC 
is sound and proper.  Looking into the 
consequence and ghastly act, the sentence 
imposed is also sound and proper and do not 
call for interference.  The appeal is 
dismissed."

5.	Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the High 
Court's judgment is clearly unsustainable being unreasoned.

6.	Learned counsel for the respondent-State supported the 
judgment.

7.	To say the least the High Court's judgment is a bundle of 
confusion.  The High Court held that the trial court has erred in 
acquitting A4 to A14, since Section 149 was invoked and 
acquitted accused persons should be equally and vicariously 
liable as they shared common object of A1 to A3 and also 
participated in the assault.

8.	The High Court noted that the State has not filed an appeal 
against the "illegal acquittal".  The High Court upheld the 
conviction holding that injury was caused on the non-vital part 
which was likely to cause the injury which is likely to cause 
death and no knowledge of causing death could be inferred from 
the overt acts.  Therefore the conviction was maintained and the 
appeal was dismissed.

9.	Since the High Court has not applied its mind to various 
contentions raised on behalf of the appellant and has in a casual 
manner disposed of the appeal, we have no hesitation in setting 
aside the impugned judgment. We remit the matter to the High 
Court for fresh disposal in accordance with law. Since the 
Criminal Appeal is to the year 2001, we request the High Court 
to dispose of the appeal as early as practicable preferably by the 
end of October, 2008.

10.  	It is stated that an application for suspension of the 
sentence of the accused persons and grant of bail moved in the 
High Court.  If the same is filed, it shall be dealt with in 
accordance with law.
