ORDER

CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 126/2008
(@SLP(Crl.) No.5273 /2006)

		Leave granted.
		The parties hereto were married in the year 1978-79. The 'Gauna' 
ceremony was solemnized in the year 1982. Allegedly, on the plea that the appellant 
had not joined her matrimonial home in the year 1997, respondent contracted a 
second marriage with Lalitabai during the subsistence of the first marriage.
		In the year 2002 she filed an application for grant of maintenance in 
terms of Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned Magistrate 
allowed the said application directing grant of maintenance @ Rs. 1,000/- per month. 
Respondent filed a revision application thereagainst. The Revisional Court set aside 
the said order opining as under: 
				-1-
	"....that helps the revisionist wherein it has been laid down that if the 
husband does not disregard the wife nor does he denies to maintain her and despite 
three letters calling her to join matrimonial home, if the wife refuses to live with her 
husband and if after enough time the husband marries second time, the wife is not 
entitled for maintenance u/s 125 Cr.P.C. if Rs. 150 demanded as maintenance for the 
son one is not entitled for Rs. 200 per month maintenance. In this regard Kamlabai 
Vs.Gajanand 1984 MPWN 170 is also considerable."

	It was concluded:

	" From the finding on issue No.1 &amp; 2 it is apparent that the applicant cannot 
be considered eligible to seek maintenance. Therefore, the maintenance as granted by 
the court below cannot be considered appropriate. For these reasons the Revision 
Petition is acceptable. Therefore, the impugned order dated 27.10.2004 as passed by 
the court below is set aside. Copy be sent to the concerned Court. Record of the court 
below be returned."
	By reason of the impugned judgment, the High Court has  refused to 
interfere with the revisional order holding that the jurisdiction of the High Court is 
limited.	
	Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that in 
view of the admitted fact that the respondent had contracted a second marriage in 
terms of explanation appended to  Sub-section 3 of Section 125 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, appellant was entitled to claim maintenance from her husband 
although she had refused to live with him.	
-2-
	The High Court while declining to exercise its revisional jurisdiction failed to 
notice that the first revisional Court was also exercising the same jurisdiction.
	For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment in Cr.Revision No. 
766/2005 dated 8.12.2005 of the High Court as also  order dated 25.6.2005 passed by 
the Sessions Judge are set aside. The order dated 27.10.2004 passed by the learned 
Magistrate is restored. 
	The appeal is allowed.
