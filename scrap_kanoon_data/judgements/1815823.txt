CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 280   OF 2008
[Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.4208/2007]

	Leave granted.
	Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and keeping in view the fact that 
the appellant is in custody for a long time and furthermore in view the role played by 
him, we direct the appellant to be released on bail. However, as there is an 
apprehension that he may tamper with the prosecution evidence, we are of the opinion 
that the terms and conditions for releasing the appellant on bail may be fixed by the 
learned Trial Judge. 

	The appeal is disposed of with the aforementioned direction and observations.
