CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 1580-81  OF 2008
[Arising out of SLP(C) Nos.21980-21981/2007]


	Leave granted.
	This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 20/8/2007 passed  by 
the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, in Civil Application Nos. 
5319/2007 &amp; 4448/2007 in First Appeal No. 541/2007 whereby and whereunder 
following interim order was passed:

	"i) The respondents are permitted to withdraw the	amount of Rs. 
5 crore by furnishing bank guarantee of any nationalised bank in respect 
of 50% of the said 	amount and security in respect of the balance 
amount.
	ii) The respondents shall keep the bank guarantee alive 
	during the pendency of First Appeal No. 541/07 and for	a 
period of 3 months thereafter.
	iii) In the event the appeal filed by the appellants is wholly or partly 
allowed, the respondents shall return the amount due to the appellants 
and deposit the same in this court within a period of eight weeks from the 
date of the judgment with interest thereon at the rate of 9% p.a. and the 
respondents shall file undertaking to that effect before withdrawal of the 
amount.

	iv) The Registry shall invest the balance amount of Rs. 5,86,17,333/- in 
any nationalised bank initially for a period of 37 months and shall renew 
the same for equal periods till the disposal of the appeal."

	Before us, when the matter came up for preliminary hearing, a statement was made 
by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants that they were 
ready and willing to furnish the bank guarantee and/or surety to the satisfaction of the 
High Court in the event the amount deposited by the State is directed to be released.  

	Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we direct that the balance amount 
may be permitted to be withdrawn by the appellants in the event they furnish bank 
guarantee therefor to the satisfaction of the High Court.

	The appeals are disposed of with the aforementioned direction.
