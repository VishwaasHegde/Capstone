1.	The learned counsel appearing for the appellants submits on 
instruction that the appellants do not wish to proceed with this 
appeal as the land in dispute has been purchased by one Bheru 
Singh, Sardar Singh and Ram Singh by a registered deed of Sale 
dated 22nd of October, 2007. Therefore, he submits that in view of 
the aforesaid fact and the dispute having been settled between the 
parties, the appeal shall not be proceeded with. Accordingly, the 
appeal is dismissed for non-prosecution. Interim orders, if there be 
any, stand vacated.
