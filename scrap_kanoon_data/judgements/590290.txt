                     CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
                             CIVIL APPEAL Nos.5220-5221 OF 2008
                              (Arising out of SLP(C)Nos.11263-11264/2008)

VINOD KUMAR VERMA                                       .....APPELLANT(S)

                                     VERSUS

MANMOHAN VERMA &amp; ANR.                                                   ....RESPONDENT(S)

                                               O R D E R

       Leave granted.

       At the time of hearing of these appeals, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

landlord-respondent submits, on instructions, that the possession of the premises in question has

already been taken over by the landlord-respondent. That being the position, these appeals have

now become infructuous, which have been filed against the final judgment and order

dt.25.02.2008 and 28.03.2008 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in RCR No.49 of

2007 and C.M.No.119 of 2008 (Review) in RCR No.49 of 2007, by which the Revision Petition

filed by the tenant/appellant was dismissed and order of eviction was affirmed.             Since the

possession has already been taken over by the landlord-respondent, in our view nothing survives

in these appeals and accordingly, the appeals are disposed of as infructuous.

       Interim order, if any, stands vacated.

       There will be no order as to costs.
