	These review petitions and other applications for 
impleadment and modification of the judgment and order 
dated 9th March, 2007, passed in Civil Appeal No. 1246 of 
2007, arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 15224 of 2006, have come 
up before us in somewhat unusual circumstances and are a 
departure from the traditional review petitions that are usually 
filed.

The above-mentioned appeal had been filed by All Bengal 
Licensees Association, Kolkata, against Raghabendra Singh, 
Principal Secretary, Excise Department, Government of West 
Bengal, and other officials of the Excise Department, against 
an order of a learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court, 
dated 29th August, 2006, passed on a contempt petition 
dismissing the same.
Holding that the contemnors had committed contempt of 
court, this Court allowed the appeal and severely warned the 
concerned officials and censured their conduct.

During the pendency of the appeal, several applications 
were filed for impleadment in the appeal, but the same were 
dismissed.  It appears that after the judgment and order dated 
9th March, 2007, was passed by this Court, several writ 
petitions were filed in this Court under Article 32 of the 
Constitution by those persons whose impleadment 
applications had been dismissed earlier.  When the said writ 
petitions were listed for admission on 20th November, 2007, 
this Court directed the Registry to treat the writ petitions as 
review petitions against the judgment dated 9th March, 2007, 
in Civil Appeal No. 1246 of 2007 and cognate matters.  The 
Registry was also directed to place all the Interlocutory 
Applications along with the Review Petitions before the Hon'ble 
Chief Justice for constituting an appropriate Bench.

That is how these matters have been placed before us.

With due respect, we suspect that the entire facts were 
possibly not brought to their Lordships' notice.

Admittedly, none of the writ petitioners were parties to 
the Civil Appeal No. 1246 of 2007.  They, therefore, have no 
locus standi to maintain a review petition in respect of the 
final order passed in a proceeding arising out of an order 
passed in a contempt proceeding relating to wilful 
disobedience of orders passed by this Court.  The writ 
petitioners are the beneficiaries of such wilful disobedience 
and will have to suffer the consequences of the actions of the 
contemnors who have been found to be guilty of contempt of 
court.

Apart from the above, the petitioners had applied for 
being impleaded as parties in S.L.P.(Civil) No. 15224 of 2006 
and such prayer was rejected and the impleadment 
applications were dismissed.  Now that the Civil Appeal arising 
out of the S.L.P(Civil) No. 15224 of 2006 stands dismissed, the 
impleadment applications filed thereafter for the same purpose 
are wholly misconceived and are liable to be dismissed.   
Consequentially, the review petitions which are dependent on 
the impleadment applications are also liable to be dismissed.  

However, the petitioners cannot be left without a remedy 
since their writ petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution 
were not taken up for consideration in the writ jurisdiction, 
but were converted into petitions for review possibly on a first 
impression that no order could be passed in the writ petitions 
and that the judgment and order passed in Special Leave 
Petition (C) No.15224 of 2006 itself was  required to be 
modified. But in the facts of the case as set out hereinabove, 
we are unable to entertain the review petitions which therefore 
merit dismissal.

In our view, the petitioners' remedy can only be taken up 
in the writ jurisdiction.  In that view of the matter, while 
dismissing  the  review  petitions and the connected petitions 
for impleadment and for hearing of the petitions in Court, we 
make it clear that the petitioners may file fresh writ petitions 
under Article 32 of the Constitution  on the same cause of 
action as their earlier writ petitions were not taken up or 
treated as writ petitions.

There will be no order as to costs.
