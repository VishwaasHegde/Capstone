CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1350  OF 2008
[Arising out of SLP(C) No.5664/2007]

	Leave granted.
	The question as to whether the appellant Insurance Company is liable in relation to 
death or bodily injury suffered by the owner of a vehicle has since been covered by the 
decisions of this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Laxmi Narain Dhut, [2007 
(4) SCALE 36] and The Oriental Insurance Company Limited vs. Meena Variyal &amp; 
Ors., [2007 (5) SCALE 269].  In Meena Variyal (supra) it was noticed by this Court:  
"We are thus satisfied that based on the ratio in Swaran Singh (2004 
3 SCC 297), the insurance company cannot be made liable in the case 
on hand to pay the compensation first and to recover it from the 
insured, the owner of the vehicle. The deceased being an employee 
not covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act, of the insured, the 
owner of the vehicle, has not been covered compulsorily under the 
Act and only by entering into of a special contract by the insured 
with the insurer should such a person be brought under coverage. 
There is no case that there is any special contract in that behalf in 
this case."

	For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained which 
is set aside and the appeal is allowed.
