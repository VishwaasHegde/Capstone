(@SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL)NO.2467 OF 2007)



		Leave granted.

		Delay condoned.

		Heard.

		In a case relating to disputes between the landlord and the tenant, the High Court, in a 
writ petition by the landlord, passed the impugned interim order enhancing the rent from 
Rs.100/- to Rs.2,000/- per month.  By interim order passed by this Court on 31.1.2007, the 
impugned order was stayed with a direction to tenant to pay rent at the old rate.
		The main writ petition is still stated to be pending before the High Court.  On the 
facts and circumstances the order passed by this Court on 31.1.2007 will hold good till the 
final disposal of the matter by the High Court.  We request the 
										  Contd...2


High Court to dispose of the writ petition pending before it expeditiously.
		The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
