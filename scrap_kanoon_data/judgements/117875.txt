under Sections 25(1B)(a) and 27 of the Arms Act, in default, to undergo further

No.2] was convicted under Section 302/114 I.P.C. and sentenced to undergo

imprisonment for a period of one month.  Accused No.2 and Mallappagari Mallareddi 
[Accused No.3], Sangati Gangireddi [Accused No.4], Pamireddi Venkataramanareddi 
[Accused No.5], Gundladurthy Subbareddi [P.W.8], Parlapalli Pedda 
Narasimhareddi [P.W.11] and Parlapalli Ramakrishnareddi [P.W.15] were convicted 
under Section 148 I.P.C. and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a 
period of three years.  Accused Nos.3,4,5,8,11 and 15 were also convicted under 
Section 302/149 I.P.C. and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay file 
of Rs.100/-; in default, to undergo further imprisonment for a period of one month. 
Mallappagari Mallareddi [Accused No.3] and Pamireddi Venkataramanareddi 
[Accused No.5] were further convicted under Section 27 of the Arms Act and 
sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three years and to pay

imprisonment for a period of three years and to pay fine of Rs.100/-; in default, to 
undergo further imprisonment for a period of one month.  All the sentences, however, 
were ordered to run concurrently.  Trial against Pamireddi Gangireddi @ Mobbodu 
[Accused No.12] abated, as the same died during the pendency of the trial.  Against 
the order of acquittal, no appeal was filed before the High Court, whereas, on appeal 
being filed by the eight convicted accused persons, including the appellant, while 
other seven accused persons have been acquitted, the convictions of the appellant 
have been upheld.  Hence, this appeal by special leave.	The prosecution case 
has been supported by the evidence of four eye witnesses, namely, Sangati Chinna 
Veera Reddy [P.W.1], Karnati Gangi Reddy [P.W.2], P. Narayanamma [P.W.3] and 
K. Gangi Reddy [P.W.4].  All the aforesaid four witnesses have received injuries and 
their evidence is consistent with the first information report.  That apart, the 
prosecution case has been corroborated by the medical evidence.  In our view, the 
High Court was quite justified in upholding the conviction of the appellant and no 
ground for interference by this Court is made out.
	The criminal appeal, accordingly, fails and the same is dismissed.
