	Under Section 6 of 2003 Act, goods specified in the Second and Third Schedules 
are charged to duty at the rates specified therein whereas goods not falling within 
the said two Schedules are assessable to duty under separate Notifications to be 
issued by the State Government.  The narrow controversy in the present case which 
arose for determination before the High Court was: Whether the above enlisted 
items fall under para 44(5) read with Section 6(1)(a) of the 2003 Act?
	According to the appellant, the said items fall under Para 44(5) which, at the 
relevant time, attracted duty at the rate of 4%, whereas, according to the 
Department, the said items came under Section 6(1)(d) read with Notification No.82 
of 2006 -  Entry No.66 which attracted the rate of duty of 12.5%.
	We have examined the impugned judgment.  In this case, we find that the High 
Court in the impugned judgment has failed to notice the Rules of Interpretation 
which require that in cases where HSN Code number is indicated against the Tariff 
Item mentioned in the Third Schedule, then one has to go by the provisions of the 
HSN as adopted by the Customs Tariff Act, 1975.  If that is the case, then, one need 
to interpret the Entries in the Third Schedule not only in the light of the Entries in 
the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 but also the judgments applicable to the corresponding 
Entries in the Customs Tariff Act.  On the other hand, it is urged on behalf of the 
Department that HSN, read with Customs Tariff Act, 1975, is not required to be 
read, in the present case, as the figure "3808" against para 44(5) stood omitted by 
Kerala Finance Act, 2006 which came into force w.e.f. 1st July, 2006.  
	At this stage, we may state that the appellant-assessee had moved the 
Commissioner under the relevant provisions of the Act for what is called as Advance 
Clarificatory Order which is very similar to Advance Ruling under the Income Tax 
Act.  The Commissioner had decided the matter against the appellant vide order 
dated 7th April, 2006.  That decision has been confirmed by the High Court vide 
impugned judgment.  
	The important point which we need to stress is that neither the Commissioner nor 
the High Court has considered the Rules of Interpretation of the Schedules to the 
Kerala VAT Act, 2003.  The High Court has failed to consider the effect of the 
omission of the figure "3808" by Kerala Finance Act, 2006.  In our view, a vital 
aspect is lost sight of.   In the present case, the High Court has held that looking to 
the HSN Code 3808.10.91  repellant for insects such as flies, mosquito, has a direct 
relation to Heading 3808.  At the same time, the High Court has held that HSN Code 
8516.79.20 of the Customs Tariff Act which deals with electrical or electronic devices 
for repelling insects fall under HSN Code 8516 and, looking at that HSN Code, the 
High Court has held that Code 3808.10.91 has to be read along with Heading 3808.  
	The basic controversy, therefore, which arose before the High Court was whether 
the above items fell within the sub-Heading 3808.10.91.  In this connection, we find 
that Kerala VAT Act is aligned with Customs Tariff which in turn is aligned with 
HSN and consequently each product in question was required to be seen in the 
context of HSN Code and judgments based thereon.
	Keeping in mind the above controversy, we set aside the impugned judgment and 
remit the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration in accordance with law.  
We may add that we express no opinion on the merits of the case.  We keep 
contentions on both sides expressly open.
	We may also clarify that under the Act, the transactions which have taken place 
prior to 7th April, 2006 will not be taken into account and the advance clarification 
will only apply for the period 7th April, 2006 onwards.  We request the High Court 
to expeditiously hear and dispose of the Statutory Appeal of the appellant, 
preferably within six months from today.

	Civil Appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
