TRANSFER PETITION(C) NOS.30-31 OF 2008

	These petitions are filed for transfer of Special Civil Application Nos.173-174 of 2008 
pending before the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad.  We had issued notice in the 
petitions and stayed further proceedings of these applications.  Now the petitioners who filed 
the Special Civil Applications before the High Court submit that they have filed applications 
for withdrawal of the Special Civil  Applications and the High Court declined the request as the 
matter is pending before this Court.
	In view of the submission made by the petitioners in Special Civil Applications before 
the High Court, these petitions do not survive. The learned counsel for the petitioners in the 
transfer petitions seeks permission to withdraw these transfer petitions.  Permission granted.  
The transfer petitions are dismissed as withdrawn.

						-2-
	The petitioners in Special Civil Applications before the High Court would be at liberty 
to again move the High Court for withdrawal of the Special Civil Applications.
