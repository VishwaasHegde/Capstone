     2.       Appellants herein, inter alia, questioned the constitutionality of Section 9-D

     of the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944. The High Court by reason of the impugned

     judgments and orders has dismissed the writ petitions filed by the appellant(s) on the

     premise that some appeals are pending before this Court involving the said question.

     Before us, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties have placed the

     details of the appeals pending before this Court which are:

            Supreme Court against the said order.
1897/1992   The CEGAT after considering the application under
            Section 35F of the Central Excise Act, 1944 seeking
            waiver of the pre-deposit of the Duty and penalty
            demanded, dismissed the same and directed the
            Petitioner and the job workers to deposit the same.
            Since the Petitioner did not comply with the said order,
            the Appeals filed by them were dismissed for non-
            compliance of the above order on 15.7.1994 and
            7.2.1996 (Copies enclosed)
1898/1992   The CEGAT confirmed the demand against the The Hon'ble Supreme
                                                                    Court     dismissed  the
            Petitioner vide order dated 4.7.1997. The Petitioner
                                                                    Appeal bearing No. 5134-

                                                                    12.9.97 for want of pre-
            Hon'ble Supreme Court against the said order.
                                                                    deposit.
                                          3
3.       None of the aforementioned appeals, it is accepted at the Bar, involve the

question of constitutionality of Section 9-D of the Act; nor having regard to the fact

that the appeals were filed by the Revenue itself, such a question could possibly be

raised. Furthermore, such a question as regards the constitutionality of a statute

cannot be raised either before the authorities under the statute, including the High

Court and this Court, while deciding the appeals against the orders passed by the

statutory authorities/Tribunals, the First Appellate Court. The question stands

covered by a decision of this Court in Dhula Bhai vs. State of M.P., (1968 (3) SCR

662); West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission vs. CESC Ltd., (2002 (8) SCC

715) and Alpha Chem vs. State of U.P., (89 STC 304).

4.       Mr. Shekhar, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents

has drawn our attention to an order dated 3.1.1995 passed by a Bench of this Court in

Civil Appeal arising out SLP(C) No.21831/1994 which is to the following effect:

                  "The impugned order dated 5.9.94 has to be read along with
         Section 9D of the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944. So read, there is
         no infirmity in the impugned order.
                  It may, however, be clarified that in case reliance is placed
         on the provisions of Section 9D of the Act in respect of any particular
         witness, intimation of the same is required to be given to the
         respondents and it would be open to the respondents to approach the
         High Court against the order made by the authority in that behalf."
                                             4
5.          Apart from the fact that by reason of the said order the parties have been

granted liberty to question the violation of the said provision or the question of

contravention of the said provision in respect of a particular witness, no embargo has

been created thereby to challenge the validity of the said provision by the appellants

before the writ Court or any superior Court.

6.          Mr. Shekhar submits that it is not a case where the appellant should be

permitted to raise such question in view of the fact that no cause of action has arisen

therefor.

7.          The High Court, as noticed hereinbefore, did not decide the question of

constitutionality of the said provision, nor did it determine the objection of the

respondents that no cause of action had arisen therefor.

8.          We are, therefore, of the opinion that interest of justice would be subserved

if the impugned judgments are set aside and the matters are remitted back to the

High Court for consideration thereof afresh. We direct accordingly.

9.          The appeals are disposed of with the aforementioned observations and

direction.

10.         However, as these matters are pending for a long time, we would request the

High Court to consider the desirability of disposing of the writ petitions, filed by the

appellants, as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of three months
                                        5

from the date of communication of this order. All contentions of the parties shall

remain open.
