O  R  D  E  R
CIVIL APPEAL NO.5147 OF 2002 


	After hearing learned counsel for the appellant and going through the impugned judgment 
and other materials on record, we do not find any ground to interfere with the concurrent finding 
of facts of the courts below.  In our view, this case is clearly hit by the provisions of Section 4 of 
the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of certain lands) 
Act, 1978.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed.  There shall be no order as to costs.
