CIVIL APPEAL NO.1405 OF 2008
(Arising out of S.L.P.(C) No.20595/2007


	Leave granted.
	These Civil Appeals are directed against the judgment dated 6th July, 2007 passed 
by the High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench, in Writ Petitions Nos.2103/2003 and 
2190/2003.
	The appellant Company is a subsidiary of Coal India Limited.  
	The challenge before the High Court in the above writ petitions filed by Koyala 
Udyog Kamgar Sanghathan was to the action of the Management in effecting 
recovery of HRA allegedly paid in excess to non-executive employees stationed at 
Nagpur (A Class).  The said recovery was made by  the  Management  purportedly  
on the ground that revised

formula for payment of HRA in terms of Wage Agreement No.VI stood 
implemented with effect from 1.7.1999 and not from 1.7.1996 as contended by the 
Sangathan.  It is contended by the Management that except the member-employees 
of the Sangathan, all other Unions in other regions understood the payability of 
HRA with effect from 1.7.1999.  This contention of the Management for recovering 
the so-called excess amount was not accepted by the High Court in its impugned 
judgment.  Hence these Civil Appeals.
	We are confining our order expressly to the facts of this case.  On facts of this 
case, we are of the view that this is a harsh case as not only the amount of 
Rs.9,56,036/- was paid to the employees but even tax was paid by the workers 
thereon.  Further on reading Annexure C1 dated 23.5.2002, it is clear that CFO had 
acted on some communications from the Central Office which were capable of two 
interpretations.  The instructions to CFO were not clear for which no fault lay at the 
doorsteps of the member-employees of the Sangathan.
	We are informed that on question of interpretation of the Wage Agreements Nos. 
V and VI and on above Instructions issued by the Standardization Committee, writ 
petitions have been filed by other Unions which are pending before the Kolkata 
High Court.

	Treating this case as a stand-alone case and without expressing any opinion on 
the interpretation of the Wage Agreements Nos.V and VI and the above 
Instructions, we direct the Management to pay to the Respondent-Sangathan 
herein/its member-employees the said sum of Rs.9,56,036/- within eight weeks.  
Arguments on both sides are kept open.  Our present order will not be cited as a 
precedent in the pending or future proceedings adopted/to be adopted by other 
Unions which will be decided on their own merits uninfluenced by the observations 
made in the impugned judgment of the Bombay High Court.  Before concluding, we 
clarify that the said amount of Rs.9,56,036/- will be paid without interest.
	These Civil Appeals are disposed of accordingly, with no order as to cost.
