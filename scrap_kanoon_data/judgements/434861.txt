ALTAMAS KABIR,J.


1.     Leave granted.


2.    On   15th   December,   2005,   the   Joint   Secretary

(COFEPOSA),         Government   of   India,    Ministry       of

Finance, Department of Revenue, New Delhi, issued

an order of detention against Shri Sanjay Bhandari,

the   husband      of   the   respondent/writ     petitioner,

under Section 3(1) of the Conservation of Foreign
                                                                     2


Exchange   and     Prevention       of     Smuggling       Activities

Act, 1974, (hereinafter referred to as "COFEPOSA"),

to   prevent    the     detenu     from        smuggling     goods    in

future.


3.   The facts which are said to have led to the

passing    of     the     detention         order      are     briefly

summarized hereunder.


4.   Shri Sanjay Bhandari obtained Export Promotion

Capital    Goods         Scheme         (E.P.C.G.)     licences       as

Service Provider in respect of four firms/companies

which were floated by him from time to time and

imported    vehicles          at    concessional           rates     for

personal    use    in    flagrant         misuse      of     the   said

licences. The said vehicles were never used for

tourist    purposes      as    declared         for   obtaining      the

E.P.C.G. licences and the Foreign Inward Remittance

Certificate shown by him did not relate                        to his

earnings   from    the    use      of    the    imported     cars.    In

addition to the above, all the vehicles which were
                                                                      3


imported        under     the      aforesaid         licences      were

registered as private            vehicles.



5.    Shri Sanjay Bhandari was found to have violated

various provisions/conditions of the Exim Policy,

Foreign       Trade      Policy        and    Customs        exemptions

notifications           and      during       the     investigations

conducted        by      the       Directorate          of      Revenue

Intelligence, 51 out of 61 vehicles were seized,

though most of them were released provisionally on

payment of differential duty and execution of Bonds

and    Bank      Guarantees.              Shri      Bhandari's     said

activities were held to amount                      to smuggling as

defined    in    Section       2(39)    of    the    Customs    Act   as

adopted in Section 2(e) of the COFEPOSA                      Act, 1974.

Considering       the         nature    and      gravity      of   Shri

Bhandari's activities over a period of time and his

high potentiality and propensity to indulge in such

prejudicial       activities       in     future,     the     order   of

detention was issued against him on 15th December,

2005, under Section 3(1) of the COFEPOSA Act, 1974.
                                                             4
6.   Aggrieved    by    the    order    of     detention,    the

detenu's wife, Ranu Bhandari, filed a Habeas Corpus

petition before the Delhi High Court challenging

the legality of the same mainly on the ground of

non-supply of various documents, which according to

the respondent, prevented the detenu from making an

effective     representation    to     the    detention   order.

Being   satisfied      that   certain    relevant     documents

which   had     been    considered       by     the   Detaining

Authority while issuing the detention order had not

been supplied to the detenu to make an effective

representative against his continued detention, the

High Court allowed his Writ Petition and quashed

the detention order dated 15th December, 2005, which

has been challenged in the appeal.



7.   The Union of India is in appeal against the

judgment and order of the High Court.



8.   Learned Additional Solicitor General, Mr. A.

Sharan, questioned the decision of the High Court

on the ground       that all the documents which had
                                                                 5


been    considered      by   the   Detaining       Authority     and

found    to    be    relevant    in     issuing    the   detention

order, had been indicated in the detention order

and supplied to the detenu. Furthermore, it was

pointed out by the learned Solicitor General that

the documents which were not supplied originated

from the detenu himself.


9.     The    learned        Additional      Solicitor      General

submitted that the question                as to what documents

were required to be             supplied to a detenu along

with     the     detention      order       has    fallen        for

consideration of this Court in innumerable cases.

The consistent view which has been taken by this

Court is that documents which had been relied upon

by the Detaining Authority to come to a decision

that    it     was   necessary     to      issue   the   order    of

detention, would have to be supplied to the detenu

to enable him to understand the grounds on which

the detention order had been passed and to make an

effective      representation         in   respect   thereof,     in

keeping with Article 22(5) of the Constitution.
                                                                   6
10.     The learned Additional Solicitor General also

submitted that apart from the aforesaid view of

general application, two other views had also been

taken     by    this     Court.       One   view     was    that   all

documents referred to or mentioned in the detention

order would have to be supplied to the detenu and

if even one of them was not supplied, the detention

order would stand vitiated. The other view was that

except for the documents which were relevant and

had been relied upon by the Detaining Authority in

passing        the    detention       order,       other    documents

mentioned in the detention order or referred to

therein were not required to be supplied to the

detenu.    The       learned   Additional      Solicitor      General

reiterated       that     in    the     instant      case    all   the

documents       on    which    the    Detaining      Authority     had

relied while issuing the detention order, had been

duly supplied to the detenu, who, however, insisted

that he should have also been provided with certain

documents which were within his knowledge.                         The

said      documents       had        been    itemised        as    his

representation         dated    12.12.2005,         the     show-cause
                                                                 7


notice dated 22.7.2004 which had been received by

him,   his   writ    petition     No.5431    of    2002    and   the

I.E.C. Code pertaining to the three proprietorship

firms belonging to him, which had not been placed

before the Detaining Authority. It was submitted

that not only did the detenu have knowledge of all

the said documents, but they were available with

the detenu.


11. In     support    of    his    aforesaid      contention     the

learned Additional Solicitor General firstly relied

on   the   decision    of    this    Court   in    Radhakrishnan

Prabhakaran vs. State of Tamil Nadu [(2000) 9 SCC

1790],     wherein    while       considering      an     identical

question     this    Court,       inter   alia,     observed      as

follows:

           "We make it clear that there is no
           legal requirement that a copy of every
           document mentioned in the order shall
           invariably be supplied to the detenu.
           What is more important is that copies
           of   only such of those documents   as
           have been relied on by the detaining
           authority     for     reaching     the
           satisfaction that preventive detention
           of the detenu is necessary shall be
           supplied to him."
                                                             8
It    was   also   observed     that      since     the     bail

application   of   the   detenu     had   not     engaged    the

attention of the Detaining Authority while passing

the   detention    order,     the   non-supply       or     non-

placement thereof before the Detaining Authority

would not vitiate the detention order.



12. The learned    Additional Solicitor General             also

referred to and relied upon the decision of this

Court in J. Abdul Hakeem vs. State of T.N. and

others [2005) 7 SCC 70],       wherein after considering

some of the earlier decisions of this Court, the

learned Judges quoted, with approval, the decision

of this Court in     Radhakrishnan Prabhakaran's case

(supra) and the observations made therein.



13.    Relying on the aforesaid view, this Court had

       held that although the copy of the passport

       of the detenu had not been supplied to him,

       though reference had been made to the same in
                                                                     9


      the detention order, what had weighed with

      the    Detaining         Authority        in     issuing       the

      detention order was a statement made by the

      detenu in his own hand-writing admitting that

      he    had   made        several        visits    outside       the

      country.         The     reference        to     the    passport

      entries     had        been    made      only     by     way    of

      reference       and     was    not      the     basis    of    the

      detention order.              On the facts of the said

      case, being of the view that non-supply of

      the    passport          of      the     detenu         had    not

      prejudicially affected his right to make an

      effective representation against the order of

      detention, it was held that the non-supply of

      the copy of the passport would not vitiate

      the detention order.


14.   Further reference was made to the decision of

      this Court in Sunila Jain vs Union of India

      [(2006)     3    SCC     321],    wherein        also    several

      decisions       of     this    Court      were     considered,

      including       that    of    Radhakrishnan        Prabhakaran
                                                              10


       (supra), and it was held that non-placement

       of    a    copy   of   the   bail   application   of   the

       detenu before the Detaining Authority was not

       sufficient to vitiate the order of detention,

       since the same was within the knowledge of

       the Detaining Authority and had been taken

       into        consideration       while      passing     the

       detention order.


15.    The       learned      Additional    Solicitor    General

urged that the instant case would fall within that

class of cases wherein this Court has held that

non-supply of all the documents mentioned in the

detention order, which had no relevance in regard

to    the     Detaining       Authority's      satisfaction   in

passing the order of detention, would not vitiate

the same. It was submitted that the High Court had

erroneously proceeded on the basis of the other

class of cases wherein this Court had held that

even if one of the grounds of detention was found

to be vague or defective or any of the documents on

which reliance had been placed by the Detaining
                                                                    11


Authority had not been supplied to the detenu, it

would   vitiate      the   detention      order,       although     the

same did not apply in the facts of this case. It

was submitted that the impugned order of the High

Court was contrary to the views expressed by this

Court   in     similar      matters       and     the    same      was,

therefore, required to be set aside.



16. The judgment and order of the High Court was,

however,      strongly     defended       on     behalf       of    the

respondent-wife of the detenu. It was submitted by

Mr. Vikram Chaudhary, learned counsel appearing for

the respondent, that this Court had consistently

held that since an order of detention adversely

affected      the    personal       liberty       and    individual

freedom of a citizen and struck at the very roots

of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles

19, 20, 21 and even 22 of the Constitution, the

same    had     to    be    carefully           scrutinized        when

challenged     by    the   detenu    on    any    of    the   grounds

available to him or her.
                                                                      12
17.   It    was    submitted      that     in    the    instant      case

      certain vital documents which could have had

      a bearing on the decision of the Detaining

      Authority while passing the detention order,

      had    not    been     placed       before       the   Detaining

      Authority as the same were in the detenu's

      favour       and    upon    considering          the    same    the

      Detaining Authority may not have issued the

      said        detention       order.              Mr.    Chaudhary

      submitted that the representation which had

      been made by the detenu on 12.12.2005, the

      agreement dated 9.11.07 executed between the

      detenu and his agents for using the resort

      for which the vehicles had been imported, the

      relevant           portions         of      the        Settlement

      Commission's order by which the detenu had

      been    absolved      of    all     criminal       proceedings,

      and the writ petition filed by the detenu,

      would have convincingly placed the case of

      the detenu before the Detaining Authority had

      they     been      before     the        said    Authority      for

      consideration. It was further submitted that
                                                                                 13


      non-supply                 of            the         said         documents,

      irrespective of whether they had originated

      from the detenu himself, had prevented the

      detenu              from             making            an          effective

      representation              against            the    detention       order,

      since without having the documents in front

      of him, it was not possible for the detenu to

      remember the contents of the said documents

      in their entirety, which contained in detail

      the    stand         of     the      detenu.          By    depriving      the

      detenu of the said documents he was deprived

      of the right guaranteed to him under Article

      22(5) of the Constitution which was mandatory

      and any breach thereof had been held by this

      Court          to     be        sufficient            to        vitiate    the

      detention order.

18.        Mr.       Chaudhary             derived          support       for    his

      aforesaid            contention            from       the       decision    of

      this       Court      in        M.    Ahamedkutty            v.    Union    of

      India          [(1990)          2    SCC       1],     wherein       it    was

      reiterated that the right under Article 22(5)

      is         a        right           to         make        an      effective
                                                                       14


      representation           and    when    some    documents        are

      referred to or relied on in the grounds of

      detention, without copies of such documents,

      the     grounds         of     detention       would       not    be

      complete.         The    detenu,        therefore,     had       the

      right    to    be       supplied      with     the   grounds     of

      detention along with the documents which were

      referred to or relied upon and if there was

      failure      or    even       delay    in    furnishing      those

      documents,        it     would        amount    to   denial       of

      making    an      effective      representation.           It    was

      also observed that it was immaterial whether

      the detenu already knew about their contents

      or    not,    but       the    non-supply      of    the    copies

      thereof was fatal as was held in Mehrunissa

      v. State of Maharashtra [(1981) 2 SCC 709].

      It was emphasised that in order to appreciate

      this point it would have to be kept in mind

      that the detenu is in jail and has no access

      even to his own documents.

19.   Learned counsel submitted that in the case of

      Ashadevi wife of Gopal Ghermal v K.Shivraj
                                                                       15


      [(1979) 1 SCC 222], this Court had indicated

      that if material or vital facts, which could

      influence the mind of the Detaining Authority

      one way or the other on the question whether

      or not to issue the detention order, are not

      placed before the Detaining Authority or are

      not    considered       by    the        said   authority,       it

      would    vitiate        its     subjective         satisfaction

      rendering the detention order illegal.



20.         Learned    counsel      submitted         that    the    said

      view     had      thereafter             been      consistently

      followed,       with    minor    variations,           since    the

      personal        liberty         of        a      citizen        was

      prejudicially affected by the passing of a

      detention       order     which          enabled       the    State

      authorities       to    detain       a    citizen      without        a

      trial.    Learned       counsel          submitted      that,    in

      fact,    the     Detaining       Authorities           have    been

      held     to     the      rigors          of     the     detaining

      enactments while passing detention orders as

      would also be clear from the decision of this
                                                                      16


      Court      in    Sk.    Nizamuddin       v    State     of    West

      Bengal [(1975) 3 SCC 395],                   where the delay

      of two and a half months in detaining the

      petitioner therein pursuant to the orders of

      detention,        was     held      to   cast       considerable

      doubts on the genuineness of the subjective

      satisfaction of the detaining magistrate and

      prompted this Court to quash the detention

      order.


21.   Learned         counsel    submitted         that     the    views

      expressed in Ashadevi's case (supra) and in

      various other similar cases were subsequently

      referred to and relied upon in State of U.P.

      v   Kamal       Kishore    Saini     [(1988)     1    SCC    287],

      while quashing the detention order impugned

      in the said case.


22.   Learned         counsel       for    the      detenu         lastly

      contended that when the Settlement Commission

      set   up    under       the    Customs       Act,     1962,    had

      absolved         the      detenu     from       all     criminal
                                                                        17


      prosecution        after       a        settlement     had       been

      reached, the Detaining Authority had issued

      the detention order only with the intention

      of     by-passing        the        order       of     the       said

      Commission         and         rendering              the        same

      ineffectual. It was submitted that in such

      circumstances no interference was called for

      with the order of the High Court which had

      rightly quashed the order of detention issued

      against the detenu on 12.12.2005.



23.   Keeping in mind the fact that of all human

      rights      the   right     to          personal     liberty      and

      individual        freedom          is     probably     the       most

      cherished, we can now proceed to examine the

      contention advanced on behalf of the parties

      in the facts and circumstances of this case.

      But before we proceed to do so, it would be

      apposite to reproduce herein below a verse

      from    a   song    which          was    introduced        in    the

      cinematographic          version           of   Joy     Adamson's

      memorable classic `Born Free', which in a few
                                                                 18


      simple    words    encapsulate          the     essence     of

      personal liberty and individual freedom and

      runs as follows:


        "Born free, as free as the wind blows,
        As free as the grass grows,
        Born free to follow your heart.
        Born free and beauty surrounds you,
        The world still astounds you,
        Each time you look at a star.
        Stay free, with no walls to hide you,
        You're as free as the roving tide,
        So there's no need to hide.
        Born free and life is worth living,
        It's only worth living, if you're born free."


24.   The    aforesaid   words        aptly     describe        the

      concept of personal liberty and individual

      freedom which may, however, be curtailed by

      preventive    detention        laws,    which    could    be

      used     to   consign     an     individual       to      the

      confines of jail without any trial, on the

      basis of the satisfaction arrived at by the

      Detaining Authority on the basis of material

      placed    before   him.    The     Courts       which     are
                                                               19


      empowered to issue prerogative writs have,

      therefore,      to     be    extremely     cautious     in

      examining the manner in which a detention

      order is passed in respect of an individual

      so that his right to personal liberty and

      individual freedom is not arbitrarily taken

      away     from   him     even      temporarily     without

      following the procedure prescribed by law.



25.   We     have   indicated       hereinbefore      that   the

      consistent view expressed by this Court in

      matters relating to preventive detention is

      that while issuing an order of detention,

      the    Detaining      Authority     must   be    provided

      with all the materials available against the

      individual concerned, both against him and

      in his favour, to enable it to reach a just

      conclusion      that        the   detention     of     such

      individual is necessary in the interest of

      the State and the general public. It has

      also been the consistent view that when a

      detention order is passed all the material
                                                                20


      relied upon by the Detaining Authority in

      making such an order, must be supplied to

      the   detenu    to     enable       him     to   make    an

      effective       representation            against        the

      detention order in compliance with Article

      22(5) of the Constitution, irrespective of

      whether he had knowledge of the same or not.

      These have been recognized by this Court as

      the   minimum       safeguards       to     ensure      that

      preventive detention laws, which are an evil

      necessity,      do    not    become       instruments    of

      oppression     in    the    hands   of     the   concerned

      authorities or to avoid criminal proceedings

      which would entail a proper investigation.



26.   In most cases the decision of this Court

      have gone in favour of detenu when even one

      of the grounds of detention did not satisfy

      the rigors of proof of its genuineness as a

      foundational fact in support                thereof. The

      decisions      rendered       in     Ashadevi's         case

      (supra), Mehrunissa's case (supra), Ayya @
                                                                     21


      Ayub's     case        [(1989)       1      SCC     374]      and

      Ahamedkutty's          case,         all       referred        to

      hereinbefore, have relied on the principle

      that    although       the    State       is    empowered      to

      issue orders of preventive detention, since

      the    liberty        of     an     individual        was      in

      question, such power should be exercised by

      the Detaining Authority on consideration of

      relevant     material,         both        against     and     in

      favour     of    the        individual         concerned,      to

      arrive     at     a    just        conclusion        that     his

      detention was necessary               in the interest of

      the    public         and     to     prevent        him      from

      continuing      to    indulge       in     activities       which

      are    against       the    public       interest     and     the

      interest of the State.


27.   This brings us to the next question as to

      whether even such material as had not been

      considered by the Detaining Authority while

      issuing the detention order, is required to

      be supplied to the detenu to enable him to
                                                         22


      make an effective representation against his

      detention.


28.   The   decisions     cited     by     the    Learned

      Additional Solicitor General in support of

      his contention that all documents mentioned

      in the detention order were not required to

      be served on the detenu, such as in J. Abdul

      Hakeem's   case   (supra),   takes   note   of   the

      earlier    decisions   in    Ahamedkutty's       case

      (supra) and Radhakrishnan Prabhakar's case

      (supra) which had make it mandatory for the

      Detaining Authority to supply copies of all

      documents which had been relied upon by the

      Detaining Authority to the detenu,          whether

      he had knowledge of their contents or not.

      Of course, in Radhakrishnan Prabhakar's case

      (supra) it was also made clear that there is

      no legal requirement that a copy of every

      document mentioned in the order has to be

      supplied to the detenu. What is, therefore,

      imperative is that copies of such documents
                                                                        23


      which had been relied upon by the Detaining

      Authority for reaching the satisfaction that

      in     the   interest        of       the     State     and     its

      citizens         the   preventive           detention      of    the

      detenu is necessary, have to be supplied to

      him.      Furthermore,       if        in     this    case,     the

      detenu's         representation         and     writ     petition

      had       been     placed        before        the      Detaining

      Authority,         which    according          to    the      detenu

      contained          his     entire           defence      to      the

      allegations made against him, the same may

      have weighed with the Detaining Authority as

      to the necessity of issuing the order of

      detention at all.


29.        We    are     inclined       to         agree     with     the

      submissions made on behalf of the respondent

      that,      notwithstanding            the      nature      of   the

      allegations        made,     he       was    entitled      to   the

      assurance         that     at     the         time     when     the

      detention          order        was         passed      all     the

      materials,        both     for    and       against     him,    had
                                                                    24


      been    placed     for    the     consideration         of   the

      Detaining Authority and had been considered

      by it before the detention order was passed,

      having    particular            regard     to     the    orders

      passed      by      the         Settlement           Commission

      appointed        under     the     provisions           of   the

      Customs Act, 1962, which absolved the detenu

      from all criminal prosecution.


30.   In the instant case, as some of the vital

      documents which have a direct bearing on the

      detention order, had not been placed before

      the      Detaining         Authority,            there       was

      sufficient ground for the detenu to question

      such omission. We are also of the view that

      on     account     of      the     non-supply           of   the

      documents mentioned hereinbefore, the detenu

      was    prevented         from     making        an   effective

      representation against his detention.



31.   In the said circumstances, we do not see any

      reason to interfere with the judgment and
                                                                                    25


      order of the High Court and the appeal is

      accordingly dismissed.


32.   In parting, we may reiterate what we have

      indicated         hereinbefore,    that             since                the

      personal liberty and individual freedom of a

      citizen      is     curtailed     by      an           order                of

      preventive          detention,         the               Detaining

      Authorities must apply their minds carefully

      and exercise great caution in passing such

      an   order   upon     being   fully      satisfied                    from

      materials which are both for and against the

      detenu that such an order is required to be

      passed in the interest of the State and for

      the public good.
