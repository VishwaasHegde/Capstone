                          CRL.MP.NO. 6442 OF 2008

                         CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 330           OF 2008



KISHOR KIRTILAL MEHTA &amp; ORS.                          Appellant (s)

           VERSUS

VIJAY KIRTILAL MEHTA &amp; ORS.                          Respondent(s)


                                       ORDER

     This application has been filed on behalf of the respondent No.1 for correction of

     certain typographical errors in the judgment delivered in the appeal on 18/02/2008.

     The details of the errors have been set out in the application. Learned counsel

     appearing for the appellants submits that he has gone through the application and

     he has no objection to such errors being corrected.

                   In that view of the matter, the application is allowed.        Let the

     corrections be carried out in the manner indicated in the application.

                   Over and above the said errors, it seems there are some other

     mistakes which have also come to notice after this application was filed, namely,
                                        -2-
                      i)      Paragraph 15 has been mentioned
                      twice at pages 10&amp;12 of the judgment. Let the
                      paragraph at page 12 be renumbered as 15A.
                      ii) At page 33 of the judgement at paragraph 39 the
                          name of the learned senior counsel for the State
                          has been wrongly shown as Mr. P.B. Sawant
                          when it should be Mr. C.J. Sawant.
                          Let the said two errors be also corrected. Let a
                          certified copy of the corrected copy of the
                          judgement be given to the parties.


The corrections made in terms of this application should not stand in the way of the

application of the appellants being heard by the Bombay High Court with regard to the

examination of the documents in question, which we are told is fixed for hearing on 16th

April, 2008.
