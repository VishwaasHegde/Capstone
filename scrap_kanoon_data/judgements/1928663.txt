Bench: R.V. Raveendran, Lokeshwar Singh Panta
                                                                                        Non-Reportable
                      IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                       CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                        CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4443 OF 2008
                     [Arising out of SLP (C) No.15019 of 2007]



S. Nageswara Rao &amp; Ors.                            ... Appellant (s)

Vs.

Government of Andhra Pradesh &amp; Ors.                ... Respondent (s)


WITH

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4444 OF 2008
[Arising out of SLP (C) No.15092 of 2007]



                                     ORDER

          Leave granted.


2.        These appeals by special leave challenge the order dated 2.9.2005 dismissing

WP No.12363 of 2005 and the order dated 13.4.2006 dismissing Review Petition

No.33006 of 2005, passed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court.

3.        The appellants allege that they were working on NMR basis at Taliperu Dam

site, Khamman District from 1986, continuously for about fifteen years (with some

artificial breaks). They approached the Andhra Pradesh State Administrative Tribunal

for regularization. The Tribunal rejected their claim. The writ petition filed by the

appellants challenging the order of the Tribunal was also rejected. The review petition

was also rejected.

                                                                                .......2.
                                           -2-
4.        The appellants submit that in regard to the similarly placed daily wage

employees in the very same project, the Andhra Pradesh High Court had directed

regularization, by order dated 13.4.2005 in WP No.10282 of 1998 - Jagannadham vs.

Engineer-in Chief, Irrigation Wing &amp; Ors, by negativing the contention of the

department that the said daily wage employees were not directly employed by the

department, but were employed through a contractor. The State Government had

challenged the said order before this Court in SLP (C) No.23679 of 2005 (Engineer-in-

Chief, IWE vs. G. Jagannadham &amp; Ors.). This Court upheld the direction regarding

regularization, without any monetary benefits, by order dated 27.2.2007.



5.        The facts in this case and the facts in Jagannadham (supra) as also the

contentions urged are virtually the same. In view of the above, we are of the view that

interest of justice will be served if this appeal is disposed of in terms of the decision in

Jagannadham (supra) by directing regularization of the services of appellants without

any monetary benefits.


6.        We accordingly allow these appeals and direct the respondents to consider

the cases of the appellants for regularization without past monetary benefits and

pass

                                                                                     .......3.
                                           -3-



appropriate orders within three months from today. The three months period shall be

reckoned in respect of each of the appellants, from the date on which he reports to the

fifth respondent for regularization. Parties bear respective costs.


                                                                            .......................J.

                                                                        .......................J.
