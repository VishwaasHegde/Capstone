1.   Leave granted.

2.   This is an appeal filed at the instance of Union of

     India against the Judgment and final order dated

     29th of December, 2005 passed by the High Court

     of Gujarat in Civil Application Nos. 12992 to

     13002 of 2005 with Letters Patent Appeal Nos.

     1446 to 1456 of 2005, by which the High Court

     had refused to condone the delay of 148 days in

     filing the Letters Patent Appeals.
                                                   2
3.   We have heard Mr. B. Dutta, learned Additional

     Solicitor General, appearing for the appellants

     and Mr. Vimal Chandra S. Dave, learned counsel

     appearing for the respondents and considering

     the facts and circumstances of the case and the

     explanations offered by the appellants in their

     application for condonation of delay, we are of

     the view that the delay in filing the LPAs must be

     condoned and LPAs be restored to its original file.

     Accordingly, we order the same.


4.   The High Court is therefore requested to dispose

     of the LPAs on merits and in accordance with law

     within a period of eight weeks from the date of

     supply of a copy of this order to it.    It is also

     made clear that at the time of hearing of the

     LPAs, it would be open to the parties to question

     the maintainability of the appeal before the

     Division Bench, which shall also be taken into

     consideration at the time of such disposal.
                                                     3
5.   Accordingly, the impugned orders of the High

     Court are set aside. The appeal is thus allowed

     to the extent indicated above. There will be no

     order as to costs.
