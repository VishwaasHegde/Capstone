	All these transferred cases arises out of the Circular dated 4.6.2001, issued by the 
State Bank of India(herein after the Bank), discontinuing with the Janata Deposit 
Scheme.  Since, the common facts and law arises in all these transferred cases we 
propose to dispose of the cases with this common order. For the sake of brevity we 
are taking facts from Transferred Case (C)No.110/2006.
	Sometime in 1971 a policy decision has been taken by introducing Janata Deposit 
Scheme.  It is stated as      the Scheme is not  viable and, therefore, by  the     
impugned Circular dated 4.6.2001 the Scheme was abandoned/discontinued. Several 
writ petitions have been filed in the different High Courts in the country challenging 
the Bank's decision dated 4.6.2001 discontinuing with the Scheme principally 
praying for a writ of mandamus for a direction to continue the Scheme and writ of 
certiorari to quash Bank's policy decision dated 4.6.2001. To avoid the multiplicity 
of proceedings and conflicting decisions the writ petitions have been transferred to 
this Court and it is how they are placed before this Court for disposal.
	We have heard the parties at length. It is undisputed that the Janata Deposit 
Scheme was introduced in 1971 based on the policy decision of the Bank. It is also 
not disputed that by another Bank's policy decision by  Circular dated 4.6.2001 and 
similar other circulars were issued in other Circles discontinuing with the Scheme.  
Since the Bank's Circular dated 4.6.2001 is relevant for the purpose of disposed of 
all these transferred cases the same is extracted in extenso :

EXTANT INSTRUCTIONS

The above scheme was introduced in 1971 with a view to inculcating savings 
habit among the low income group and to mobilize small savings at their 
doorsteps, with  the passage of time the scheme has lost its popularity 
specially in view of the changed Banking scenario in the country.  The scheme 
is not also economically viable and has contributed to a number of frauds.
REVISED INSTRUCTIONS
In view of the above, it has been decided to discontinue the scheme with 
effect from 1st July, 2001 with the provision that the existing accounts will be 
allowed to run till their maturity.  Accordingly, no new account will be 
opened or additional deposit received in the existing accounts from 1st July, 
2001.

advising with regard to the issues related to dispensing with the services of 
the Janata Deposit Collectors.
3.	Please ensure accordingly.
RATIONALE 
Due to non-viability of the scheme

INDEX :P. Personal Banking Segment-Janata Deposit Scheme
       J. Janta Deposit Scheme-Personal Banking Segment

	A perusal of the Circular as referred above would clearly show that the Scheme is 
not economically viable. The Scheme has also contributed a number of frauds.  In 
our 
view, having regard to the facts mentioned in the order we do not see any arbitrary 
exercise of power by the authority concerned in discontinuing with the Scheme, as 
contended by the learned counsel of the petitioners.  Similarly, when  the concerned 
authority introduced the Scheme as a policy decision the same authority can 
discontinue or abandon the Scheme in accordance with a policy decision of the 
concerned authority. It is now well settled principle of law that the Court does not 
interfere with the policy decision of the authority concerned unless such decision is 
tainted with malafide or arbitrary. As already pointed out the reading of a policy 
decision in a Circular dated 4.6.2001 we do not see any arbitrariness or taint of 
malafide.
	Learned counsel has referred to the decision of this Court rendered in Indian 
Banks Association vs. Workmen of Syndicate Bank and others, 2001(3)SCC 36. In 
that case the dispute was raised that the employees  working in the Janata Deposit 
Scheme should be absorbed as regular workmen. While this Court said that 
employees in Janata Fixed Deposit Scheme were held to be workmen, the direction 
for absorption as a regular workman has been rejected. A contention has, therefore, 
been raised that since the employees of Janata Deposit Scheme are workmen they are 
entitled to retrenchment compensation under Section 25F of Industrial Disputes Act.  
This contention, in our opinion, has no substance.  As already noted, the Scheme 
itself has been abandoned by way of policy decision and, therefore, we do not see any 
infraction of Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act.
	For the reasons stated above, all these transferred cases are disposed of. The writ 
petitions stand dismissed.
I.A.NOS. 15-41 IN T.P.(C) NOS.645-658/2004
	I.A.Nos.15 to 41, applications for impleadment/ intervention and restoration of 
work to deposit collectors, are dismissed.
