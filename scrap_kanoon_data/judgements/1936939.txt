	CRIMINAL APPEAL NO 596 2008
(arising out of S.L.P.(Crl) No. 5194/2006)

1.	Leave granted.

2.	This appeal is directed against the order dated 24th 
July 2006 rejecting the prayer for quashing of FIR No.83 dated 
12th March 2005 P.S. City Sonepat registered under Sections 
419,420,465,468,469,471,472,474 read with Section 34 of the 
IPC.  During the pendency of these proceedings in this Court, 
Crl.Misc.Petition No. 42/2008 has been filed putting on record 
a compromise deed dated 30th April 2007.  The fact that a 
compromise has indeed been recorded is admitted by all sides 
and in terms of the compromise the disputes which are purely 
personal in nature and arise out of commercial transactions, 
have been settled in terms of the compromise with one of the 
terms of the compromise being that proceedings pending in 
court may be withdrawn or compromised or quashed, as the 
case may be.  In the light of the compromise, it is unlikely that 
the prosecution will succeed in the matter.   We also see that 
the dispute is a purely personal one and no public policy is 
involved in the transactions that had been entered into 
between the parties.  To continue with the proceedings, 
therefore, would be a futile exercise.  We accordingly allow the 
appeal and quash FIR No.83 dated 12th March 2005 P.S. City 
Sonepat and all consequent proceedings.
