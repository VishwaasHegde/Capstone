CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.136 OF 2008
[Arising out of S.L.P.(Crl.)No.2908 of 2007]


	Leave granted.
	Respondents filed an application before the High Court of Gujarat for setting aside 
FIR No.119 of 2006 lodged by the appellant at Mahila Thana, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 
for offences under Section 498A/323/504/506, IPC and 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act with 
a prayer for ad interim relief.
	The High Court, by the impugned order, while issuing notice in the matter, has stayed 
the investigation in respect of the aforementioned FIR.  
	In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the High Court 
should not have stayed the investigation.  Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside 
and the case is remitted to the High Court for deciding the dispute on merits in 
accordance with law without being influenced by any of the observations made 
hereinabove.
	The appeal is allowed accordingly.
