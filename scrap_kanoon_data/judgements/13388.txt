     CIVIL APPEAL NOS.3888-3889 OF 2001

P.S.Ramakrishna Reddy &amp; Anr.               ...Appellants

VERSUS

Authorised Officer, Land
Reforms, A.P.                             ...Respondent


                     ORDER

1.   These     appeals   are    directed    against   the

judgment and order dated 7th of December, 1999

passed by the High Court of Judicature of Andhra

Pradesh at Hyderabad in Civil Revision Petition

Nos.1662 and 1663 of 1995.

2.   The High Court, while dismissing the civil

revision case, solely relied on a decision of the

Division Bench of that High Court, namely, U.Sarat

Kumar    vs.   Authorised      Officer,   Land   Reforms

reported in 1998 (1) A.L.T. 496. The aforesaid


                                                           1
decision of the High Court in U.Sarat Kumar's case

has been affirmed by this Court in the case of

Makineni      Venkata   Sujatha   vs.    Land       Reforms

Tribunal &amp; Anr. reported in 2000 (8) SCC 196.

Since the question raised before the High Court as

well as before us is now covered by the aforesaid

decision of this Court reported in 2000 (8) SCC 196,

there is no question to interfere with the impugned

judgment.

3.      Accordingly, the appeals are dismissed with no

order as to costs. The interim order, if any, stands

vacated. The lower court record if lying in this

Registry, the same may be sent back at an early

date.
