VERSUS

Parminder Singh                             ...Respondent

                        O R D E R

1.   Leave granted.


2.   This appeal is directed against an order

dated 24th September, 2007 passed by a learned

Judge of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at

Chandigarh in Civil Revision Petition No.3494 of

2007 whereby the High Court had dismissed the

revision petition filed by the tenant/appellant.

     An     eviction    proceeding        was   initiated

against the appellant in respect of a shop on

the ground floor of Shop-cum-Flat NO.5 Sector

20-C,     Chandigarh   in   which   the    appellant   was

inducted as a tenant at a monthly rental of
                                                               2


Rs.500/-       per        month     by     the       respondent.

Subsequently, in the month of April, 2007, an

eviction       petition           was      filed       by      the

respondent/landlord on the ground of personal

need which was allowed by Rent Controller and

against the said order of Rent Controller, an

appeal was filed before the Appellate Authority

which is still now pending. During the pendency

of the appeal before the Appellate Authority,

the    landlord           filed     an     application          for

determination        of     the    provisional        rent/mesne

profits    inter      alia        claiming     rent     @     Rs.58

sq.ft/Rs.55 sq. ft. The Appellate Authority on

the     said        application          for       determination

determined the provisional rent/mesne profits @

Rs.59/-sq. ft (Rs.9600/- per month) and feeling

aggrieved by such determination, the appellant

had    filed    a     revision          petition      which     was

dismissed by the impugned order.

      Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid order of

the High Court passed in the revision petition

affirming the order of the Appellate Authority,
                                                                  3


a    special    leave         petition    was   filed     which       on

grant of leave was heard in presence of the

learned counsel for the parties.

      Having heard the learned counsel for the

parties        and       considering           the      facts     and

circumstances            of      the      present        case     and

particularly         considering         the     fact     that    the

appellant       had      been     using     the       premises        in

question for commercial purpose, we are of the

view that the order of the Appellate Authority

can be modified by directing the appellant to

pay Rs.5,000/- per month provisionally till the

disposal       of     the      appeal     pending       before    the

Appellate Authority. Accordingly, we dispose of

this appeal by directing the appellant to pay or

deposit at the rate of Rs.5000/- as provisional

rent/mesne profits every month till the disposal

of the appeal now pending before the Appellate

Authority. The Appellate Authority is directed

to    dispose       of   the     appeal    at    an     early    date

preferably within three months from the date of

supply of a copy of this order.
                                                                       4


    The appeal is thus disposed of. There will

be no order as to costs.
