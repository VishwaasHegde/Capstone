CIVIL APPEAL NO.6761 OF 2001
[With C.A.No.6762 of 2001]


		Inspite of service of notice in Civil Appeal Nos.6761 and 
6762 of 2001, none appears on behalf of the respondents. 
So far as C.A.No.6762 of 2001 is concerned, this appeal 
has been preferred against the judgment and order passed by 
a Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay holding that in 
view of the decision of this Court in the case of Ramchandra 
Goverdhan Pandit vs. Charity Commissioner of State of 
Gujarat, [AIR 1987 SC 1598], the Letters Patent Appeal filed 
against the order of the learned Single Judge was not 
maintainable in law. In our view, Civil Appeal No.6762/2001 
has now become infructuous, in view of the fact that the said 
appeal was filed against the original order of the learned Single 
Judge in respect of which Civil Appeal No.6761 of 2001 has 
been filed. Accordingly, this appeal being Civil Appeal No. 
6762/2001 having become infructuous is disposed of 
accordingly. So far as C.A.6761 of 2001 is concerned, we find 
that the learned Single Judge while dismissing the appeal had 
not passed any reasoned and speaking order after applying his 
mind and after considering the available records. In this view 
of the matter, we set aside the impugned order and the matter 
is remitted back to the learned Single Judge for 
reconsideration of the case after giving hearing to the parties 
and dispose of the same after applying his mind, after passing 
a reasoned order in accordance with law. The impugned order 
is, therefore, set aside and the appeal is allowed to the extent 
indicated above. There will be no order as to costs.
