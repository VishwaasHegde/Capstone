    	     Delay condoned.

	     Leave granted.

              We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
	In the instant case all the three courts have convicted the appellant herein for an 
ofence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  
Thereafter the matter has been settled between the parties and an affidavit to that 
effect is filed.  In the said affidavit it was stated that the deponent original 
complainant had received the entire amount covered by the cheque along with interest 
and other expensed and she was ready for a compromise and she has no objection if 
the offence against the appellant is compounded. 

	 Recently, this Court has taken the view in Vinay Devanna Nayak vs. Ryot Seva 
Sahakari Bank Ltd., reported in JT 2007 (13) 382, that such offence can be 
compounded.

	  On the facts and in the circumstances of the

			:2:

case, therefore, the offence is compounded.  The appellant is acquitted under sub-
section (8) of Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

	Appeal is, accordingly, allowed. to the extent indicated above.
