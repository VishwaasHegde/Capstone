    CIVIL APPEAL NO.3163 OF 2008
(Arising out of SLP(C) No.18862 of 2007)


	We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
	Leave granted.
	This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and 
order dated 13th February, 2007 passed by the learned Single Judge of 
the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in R.S.A. No.2239 of 2006 where 
the appeal was admitted but no stay of operation of the judgment of the 
Trial Court was granted and it was observed that if excess payment is 
made then amount can always be recovered.  This was not the correct 
approach.  Once an appeal has been admitted, normally the Court should 
have stayed the operation of the judgment subject to some conditions.

			-2-
	However, the notice was given in this case and an interim order was 
passed by this Court on 6th September, 2007.
	Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we 
confirm the interim order dated 6th September, 2007 and request the High 
Court to dispose of the matter expeditiously preferably within a period of 
six months.
	The appeal is accordingly, disposed of.
