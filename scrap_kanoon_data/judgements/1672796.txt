O R D E R 
(Arising out of SLP (C) No. 22720 of 2007)
[WITH Civil Appeal No. 592 of 2008 arising out of S.L.P. (C) 
No. 24202 of 2007)
	
     Leave granted.

	Heard learned counsel for the parties at length.

	These appeals emanate from the judgment of the High 
Court of Judicature at Patna dated 5.10.2007 passed in 
Company Appeal No. 9 of 2007.  

     The relevant portion of the order of the High Court dated 
5.10.2007 is as under:

Having heard counsel for the parties it is deemed 
expedient to direct the appellant to furnish the 
ownership document of the five sale Estates as also 
other assets as per the Transfer Document before 
the Board on or before 26th October, 2007, 
whereafter the Board will retain those documents 
until the amount specified in terms of clause (4) of 
the Transfer Document is finalized and paid by the 
party concerned after taking into account the 
statutory and other deductions.  It is open for the 
Board to finalize the amount in terms of clause (4) 
of the Transfer Document even prior to 26th 
October, 2007 but while adjudicating on statutory 
and other deductions the Board will give a reasoned 
order specifying the sum concerning each of the 
sub-clauses of clause (4) of the Transfer Document 
so that there may not be any confusion in the mind 
of the parties.  It is made clear that if the ownership 
documents are not produced before the Board on or 
before 26th October, 2007 then the Board shall 
proceed with the execution proceedings as they are 
already proceeding. 

	
     It may be pertinent to mention that this Court in Civil 
Appeal No. 9446 of 2003 (Manish Mohan Sharma &amp; Ors. v. 
Ram Bahadur Thakur Ltd. &amp; Ors.) on the basis of 
Memorandum of Family Arrangement passed a comprehensive 
order on 21.3.2006.  The relevant portion of the order dated 
21.3.2006 is as follows:

	We note that the MOFA and Transfer 
Document were the outcome of the commendable 
and determined efforts on the part of the Company 
Law Board to bring to an end disputes between the 
parties in a manner which would have been in the 
interest of the respondent no 1 given the impasse 
between the two blocks of shareholders and saved 
the parties a lot of unnecessary harassment, 
expenditure and acrimony.  We also sought to bring 
an end the dispute by proposing measures which 
might be acceptable to both.  However, such 
resolution does not appear to be possible.  Therefore 
it must be left to the Company Law Board to 
execute its order dated 19th August, 1999 in 
accordance with the settled principles of law and in 
terms of the opinion expressed by us in this 
judgment.  The impugned decisions of the Company 
Law Board and the High Court are for the reasons 
earlier stated set aside.  The appeals are allowed 
and the matter remanded back to the Company Law 
Board for completing the implementation of the 
order dated 19th August, 1999 by executing the 
same.


	As the orders passed by the High Court of Patna and the 
Company Law Board are in pursuance of the order passed by 
this Court on 21.3.2006 in Civil Appeal No. 9446 of 2003, no 
interference is called for.

	The civil appeals being devoid of any merit are 
accordingly dismissed.  In the facts and circumstances of the 
case, we direct the parties to bear their own costs.
