TRANSFER PETITION(C) NO. 338 OF 2007

	This is wife's petition for transfer of Matrimonial Suit No.46/2005 from District 
Judge, Alipore, Dist. South 24 Parganas to the Court of District Judge, Guwahati, Dist. 
Kamrup, Assam.  The ground taken is that the distance between Guwahati and Alipore 
is about 1200 kms. and she would be in a difficulty to cover the distance by train 
journey. This is a good ground for transfer.

	Accordingly, transfer petition is allowed.  The Matrimonial Suit No.46/2005 titled as 
Swapan Kumar Saha Vs. Kalpana Saha, pending before the District Judge, Alipore, 
Dist. South 24 Parganas in West Bengal stands transferred to the Court of District 
Judge, Guwahati, Dist. Kamrup, Assam.
