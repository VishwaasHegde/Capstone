O R D E R

	Leave granted.
	Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the High 
Court having failed to assign sufficient or cogent reasons for interfering with the 
judgment of conviction and sentence passed as against the accused  Amjad Ali Khan, 
Sk. Harun, Hafizul Sk. and Jahagir Ali Khan  under  Section 302/149  of the  Indian 
Penal Code, 
				-2-	
whereas convicting Mokram Sikari @ Kalu under Section 302 of  IPC and at the same 
time setting aside the conviction and sentence of Sk. Harun and Mokram Sikari @ 
Kalu under Sectin 324/149 IPC, and recording a judgment of acquittal as against the 
accused Sk. Harun, Amzad Ali Khan, whereas convicting Mokram @ Kalu under 
Section 302, and at the same time acquitting him from other charges; the impugned 
judgment cannot be sustained and it is set aside accordingly. The matter is remitted to 
the High Court for consideration thereof afresh.  

	We would request the High Court to consider the desirability of disposing of the 
matter as expeditiously as possible.    
	The respondents in criminal appeal arising out of S.L.P.(Crl.) No. 4200/2007 shall 
continue to remain on bail. 
	The appeals are disposed of with the aforementioned observation and direction.
