CIVIL APPEAL NO.5795 OF 2002
WITH
CIVIL APPEAL NOS.1830/2002, 5794/2002, 4488-4490/2002


	This order shall dispose of Civil Appeal Nos.5795/2002, 1830/2002 and 5794/2002 filed by 
the revenue and Civil Appeal Nos.4488-4490 of 2002 filed by the assessee relating to the same 
assessment years. Facts are common.
	For the sake of convenience, the facts are taken from Civil Appeal No. 5795 of 2002.
	Respondent/assessee is a builder which belongs to Ravi Builders Group of cases and 
carried on business of construction.  Search under Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 
(for short 'the Act') was carried out at the residence as well as business premises of the 
assessee/partner/director(s) of the company on 24-25/12/1996.  During the course of search, a 
statement on oath of Chandrakant Patel, Director of assessee's company was recorded under 
Section 132(4) of the Act.  Chandrakant Patel admitted that the assessee's company had 
charged "on money" on sale of flats/tenements of Ravi Ratna Park Project and admitted 
concealed income of Rs.15 lacs in the case of the company and another Rs.11 lacs in other 
group of cases.
	The Assessing Officer on 31st August, 1988 passed an order under Section 158 BC read 
with 158 BD of the Act for block assessment for the period 1985-86 to 21.12.1996.  The 
Assessing Officer  made various additions on the following basis:

"a) During course of search, voluminous incriminating were also 
seized which contained information regarding charging of "on 
money" at different rates for different types of premises. On the 
basis of these, the AO estimated that the assessee had earned 
"on money" of Rs.2,48,52,961/- on sale of flats in various 
projects.  This included extra money charged by the assessee 
from certain tenement holders who were given larger land area.  
After considering all the relevant factors and also written 
submissions of the assessee, an addition of Rs.2,48,52,961/- was 
made.

(b)	An addition of Rs.82,43,909/- was made on account of 
unaccounted expenditure on the basis of seized material out of 
which Rs.28,17,909/- was made on substantive basis, whereas 
addition of Rs.2,26,000/- was made on protective basis.

)	An addition of Rs.15 lacs was made on the basis of 
statement recorded under Section 132(4) of the Act.

	Accordingly, the block assessment dated 31.8.1998 was finalized under section 158 BC 
read with Section 158 BD of the Act  by the Assessing Officer after making the following 
additions:

"(1) admitted concealment Rs.1500000.oo under Section 132(4)

(2)	On money charged on Rs. 24852961.00 sale of flats.

(3)Unaccounted income on the basis of seized papers:

Substantive   Rs. 28,17,909/-
Protective    Rs.54,26,000/-

	       Rs.82,43,909/-"


	In appeal, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (for short 'the Tribunal') vide its order 
dated 19th August, 1999 deleted the additions made at serial Nos. 1 and 3, quoted above.  The 
addition  at serial No.2 regarding 'On money"  was reduced to Rs.64,35,000/- and further 
allowed deduction of estimated expenditure against "on money" @ 30% of the estimated "on 
money" receipts i.e. Rs.19,20,000/-.
	Tribunal accepted the assessee's contention that it had  charged on money @ 30% of the 
document price.  Accordingly, the Tribunal reduced the estimate of "on money" to Rs.64 lacs 
including the money of Rs.2.17 lacs charged by the assessee for extra land given to certain 
tenement holders.  Tribunal also directed the AO to allow deduction of 30% as unaccounted 
expenditure incurred out of unaccounted receipts.  Thus, the Tribunal estimated on money 
receipts at Rs.64 lacs and expenses at Rs.19.20 lacs, leaving unaccounted income of Rs.44.80 
lacs as against Rs.2,48,52,961/- made by the Assessing Officer.
	While doing so, the Tribunal recorded its findings by observing thus:

"16.We have carefully considered facts and material placed 
before us as well as the rival submissions made on both sides.  
In so far as the basis issue of charging of on money on booking 
of flats in the Ravi Ratna Park project is concerned, we find that 
there is ample supporting evidence on records. Documents and 
papers seized from the residence of Sri Piyush R.Patel, Director 
and the office premises of the assessee company elaborately 
discussed in the impugned order and referred above by us 
clearly indicate that the assessee has charged  on money while 
booking of units in the projects. The statements of Shri 
Chandrakant R.Patel, Director of the assessee company, 
recorded on 25.12.1996 and again on 8.1.1997 constitute 
unequivocal admission of on money charged by the assessee 
company.  These sworn statements are corroborated by seized 
documents and records from the premises of the assessee 
company. Shri Chandrakant R.Patel submitted an affidavit 
during the assessment proceedings resiling from the aforesaid 
sworn  testimony.  However, it is to be borne in mind that the 
admission of the Director regarding charging of on money on 
the booking of flats is corroborated by documents seized during 
the search operations. Admission made by the assessee during 
search operations constitute substantial evidence in view of 
Section 17 and 21 of the Indian Evidence Act.  The admission is 
fully corroborated by documents and records which are 
inculcatory in nature.  The affidavit of the Director filed by the 
assessee company is in our opinion merely a self serving 
document and does not deserve any weight.  A very heavy onus 
lay upon the assessee to refute and controvert the admission 
made at the time of search operations and the said onus has not 
been discharged in the instant case. Since the Ld. counsel for the 
assessee very candidly submitted that the assessee company no 
longer wishes to resile from the statements of Shri Chandrakant 
Patel, Director and the affidavit filed during the assessment 
proceedings may be ignored, we need not dwel upon this aspect 
of the matter further.

17.In the facts and circumstances of the case as discussed above, 
we feel that the estimates of on money charged on flats in the 
various blocks adopted by the AO in the assessment order at 
Rs.2,48,52,961 are excessive and cannot be sustained.  The same 
price adopted by the AO for block A,D and E Flats at Rs.5 lacs 
per unit on the basis of the seized documents A/3 page 1 does 
not appear to be reasonable.  The said paper pertains to sale of 
Flat Nos. 132 and 133 in D block, which is situated at the corner 
of the main road having the ideal location in the block. Further 
more it is to be borne in mind that the area of the plot of land 
for D type flat is 132 sq. yds. whereas in E Block the area of the 
plot of land is 78 sq. yards only. As regards A block, in this 
block, the purchasers of the flat do not get the ownership rights 
over the plot of land.  Looking to the fact that the same price 
fixed by the Govt. in respect of flats in A, D and E blocks at 
Rs.2,29,000 and Rs.2,24,000 per unit, we felt that the on money 
charged per flat @ Rs.66000 for A &amp; D block and Rs. 67,000 
for E block, admitted by Shri Chandrakant Patel, Director in his 
statement dated 25.12.1996 appears to be  reasonable . 
Similarly, with regard to F type documents the sale price fixed 
by the govt. per unit is Rs.1,90,000 whereas the AO has adopted 
the figure of Rs.2,25,000 which is almost double the price fixed 
by the govt. the on money charged with respect to this block @ 
Rs.36,000 per unit admitted by the Director in his statement 
appears to be reasonable and is upheld.  Similarly with regard 
to shops, 23 shops have been booked during the block period 
under consideration and the sale price fixed by the govt. per 
shops is Rs.49,393 the on money charged per shop indicated by 
the ld. counsel before at Rs.15,000 per shops appears to be a 
reasonable estimate. We feel that the figure of total on money 
receipts as per the submissions of the ld. counsel before us is I 
the circumstances of the case a reasonable estimate and we 
uphold the same.  By sustaining the on money receipts at Rs.64 
lacs as above (including Rs.2,17,000 received on account of extra 
land as conceded by the ld. counsel before us) is broadly based 
on adopting the on money received per unit @ 30% of the price 
fixed by the Govt.  So various factors, like location of blocks as 
well as the flats, reasurement of plot of land attached thereto 
etc. have been taken into consideration while adopting the 
aforesaid estimate.  The fact that the director of the company in 
his statement before the tax authorities has indicated the 
aforesaid figures of on money charged and reiteration of this on 
money figure before us by the  Ld. counsel have also been 
relevant consideration with us.

18.One of the contentions raised by the Ld. counsel, which 
remains to be considered         by us, is that on money receipts 
on booking of flats can be brought to tax only in the years 
during which conveyance deeds in respect of the flats are 
executed and sales thereof are complete.  According to the Ld. 
counsel, on money receipts cannot be taxed during the block 
period, since no deeds are executed.  We are not persuaded to 
accept the arguments o the Ld. counsel on money received by 
the assessee in cash outside the books of account at the time of 
booking of the flats is over and the advance money paid by the 
buyers which are accounted for in the books of account.  Thus, 
according to the mercantile system of accounting, on money 
received by the assessee outside the books of account at the time 
of booking becomes the income of the assessee and it is in no 
way related or connected with the completion of the sales 
transaction.  Whether the booking of the flats ultimately 
culminates in the execution of the conveyance deeds or not, 
premium or on money received by the assessee at the time of 
booking partakes of the character of commercial receipts of the 
assessee and is, therefore, liable to be assessed as income 
according to the accepted principles of commercial accounting.  
The contention of the ld. counsel is, therefore, rejected.

19.The next issue, which is required to be considered is the 
claim of deduction of expenses incurred by the assessee outside 
the books of account against the on money receipts.  We find, 
there is merit in the contention of the Ld. counsel that the 
assessee company has incurred expenses outside the books of 
account, which is duly corroborated by the documents and 
records seized during the search operation.  The AO has 
enumerated such expenses in the assessment order and made 
substantive addition of Rs.218,17,909 on account of such 
unaccounted expenses incurred outside the books of account. 
Ld. counsel has made before us detailed submissions with 
regard to various items of the expenses treated as unexplained 
by the AO in the assessment order.  Ld. counsel submitted that 
out of the aforesaid addition of Rs.28,17,909 certain expenses 
are accounted for in the books and the balance expenses even if 
these are unaccounted, they are liable to be allowed as 
deductible business expenditure against the on money receipts. 
The particulars of such unaccounted expenses as indicated by 
the Ld. counsel are as under:

The AO has adopted
The figure as Rs.3,49,000

According to the assessee, amount of Rs.1,13,000 represents 
receipts for extra land and therefore, the amount involved as per 
this paper is Rs.2,39,000 only.

20.Ld. counsel submitted that apart from the aforesaid 
expenses, which are incurred outside the books of account 
evidenced by seized documents, there may be other expenses 
also incurred by the assessee outside the books of account, like, 
extra payments made to the land owners or other expenses for 
which documents have not been found during the search 
operations.  In the circumstances of the case, we feel that 
deduction on account of expenses may be estimated at 30% of 
the on money receipt of Rs.64 lakhs indicated above.  On this 
basis, the AO would allow deduction of Rs.19.20 lakhs.  We 
would accordingly uphold the addition of Rs.64 lakhs  19.20 
lakh = Rs.44.80 lakhs as against Rs.2,48,52,961 added by the 
AO on account of on money receipts. The balance addition of 
Rs.2,03,72,961 is deleted. This disposes of ground No.4 in the 
assessee's appeal."

	Revenue as well as assessee filed appeals before the High Court and raised the following 
questions of law arising from the order of the Tribunal for its consideration.  Assessee's 
questions of law read thus:
	a. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, 
the ITAT was right in law in holding that the assessment 
proceedings were not barred by the period of limitation?
	b. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, 
the ITAT was right in law in estimating "on money" receipt at 
Rs.64,00,000/-?

	c. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, 
the ITAT was right in holding that the appellant would have 
incurred expenditure of only 30% as against the claim of the 
appellant of at least 92%?
	d. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, 
the findings reached by the ITAT that the appellant received 
"on money" of Rs.64,00,000/- or that the expenditure of the 
appellant could have been only Rs.19.2 lacs is not contrary to 
record and perverse?
 Revenue's questions of law read thus:

	a.Whether the Appellate Tribunal is right in law and 
on facts in restricting the addition made on account of on money 
receipt to Rs.44.80 lacs as against Rs.2,48,52,961/- made by the 
assessing officer?

	b.Whether the appellate Tribunal is right in law and 
on facts in deleting the addition of Rs.82,43,909/- which 
included substantive addition of Rs.28,17,909/- on account of 
unaccounted expenses incurred by the assessee and 
Rs.54,26,000/- made on protective basis?

	c.Whether the Appellate Tribunal is right in law and 
on facts in deleting Rs.15 lacs made on the basis of statement 
recorded under section 132(4) of the Act?

	d.Whether the finding of Appellate Tribunal in 
deleting the addition are perverse in case it does not take into 
consideration material facts available on record and taking into 
accounts only the submissions made by the assessee?

	The questions raised by the assessee were rejected. It was held that the findings recorded 
by the Tribunal were on facts and therefore no substantial question(s) of law arose from the 
findings recorded by the Tribunal. In so far as revenue's appeals are concerned, the High 
Court accepted the second question  and formulated the same as under:
"Whether the Appellate Tribunal is right in law and on facts in 
deleting  the addition of Rs.82,43, 909/- and whether the said 
finding is not perverse in the absence of any reasons?"

	The aforesaid question formulated and accepted by the High Court  is pending 
consideration before the High Court.  Questions of law at serial Nos. a, c and d were rejected  
by observing that findings recorded by the Tribunal were on facts and therefore no substantial 
question of law arose.
	After perusing the findings recorded by the Tribunal, we are in agreement with the view 
taken by the High Court that question Nos. a, c and d are based on facts and therefore, 
substantial question of law did not arise from the findings recorded by the Tribunal.  
	In view of the foregoing reasons, the appeals filed by the revenue are dismissed.
	In view of dismissal of revenue's appeal, counsel for the assessee does not press the 
assessee's appeals.
	The Appeals are dismissed accordingly.
