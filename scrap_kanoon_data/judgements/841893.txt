 CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS.105-106 OF 2008
(@SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CRL.)NOS.8205-8206 OF 2007)


		Leave granted.
2.		Heard both sides.
3.		The second respondent herein had originally filed a complaint and on the 
basis of that complaint the police had registered a case against the appellant herein under 
Sections 109, 409, 420 IPC and 13(1)(c), 13(1)(d)(ii) and (iii) of the Prevention of Corruption 
Act, 1988.  
4.		The appellant, a Member of the Bar and Member of Parliament had moved an 
application for anticipatory bail.  Learned Single Judge, by order dated 3.12.2007,  was 
pleased to grant anticipatory bail subject to the condition that  the appellant should deposit a 
sum of Rs.10,27,504/- before the Principal Sessions Judge,Chennai within four weeks.
5.		The appellant submits that the condition  should not have been imposed as it 
is not a case where the complainant has made   any claim against the appellant accused.  
There is also


some confusion as to whether the learned counsel for the appellant volunteered to deposit 
such amount or whether the said amount was specified at the instance of the State counsel 
and counsel for Intervenor.  Be that as it may. The     appellant   is   a   sitting M.P. and this 
condition is unnecessary   to  ensure his presence.  So we delete the first condition imposed 
by the High Court regarding deposit of the above mentioned sum by the appellant. As a 
consequence, the second condition is also modified directing the appellant to execute a bond 
for a sum of Rs.25,000/- with one surety for  a like sum, to the satisfaction of the Principal 
Sessions Judge, Chennai.  In other respects, the order passed by the learned Single Judge is 
upheld.  The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
