SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION [C] NO.8263 OF 2007


1.	This special leave petition is filed against the final 
judgment and order dated 22nd of January, 2007 passed by the 
High Court of Judicature at Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur Bench at 
Gwalior, in Miscellaneous Appeal No.784 of 2006, whereby the 
High Court had dismissed the application for condonation of 
delay in filing an appeal for a delay of 769 days.

2.	We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and 
have also examined the impugned order as well as the 
application for condonation of delay in filing the appeal by the 
petitioner.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and 
going through the averments made in the application for 
condonation of delay, we are of the view that the facts stated in 
the said application do constitute sufficient cause for condoning 
the delay in filing the appeal.  The application for condonation 
of delay in filing the appeal is allowed on payment of costs of 
Rs.10,000/- to the respondents within a period of three months 
from the date of communication of this order.  In the event, the 
cost of Rs.10,000/- is not paid or deposited within the time 
specified above, the impugned order shall stand confirmed and 
the application for condonation of delay shall stand rejected.  
On the above conditions, the impugned order stands set aside. 
The appeal filed by the petitioner is restored to its original file.  
The petition for special leave is disposed of accordingly.
