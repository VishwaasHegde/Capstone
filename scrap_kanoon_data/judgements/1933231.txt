CIVIL APPEAL NO.2594 OF 2006

KAPADIA, J.
In this civil appeal filed by the Department the question 
of law arises for determination which question is as follows: 
"Whether interest paid in respect of borrowings on 
capital assets not put to use in the concerned 
financial year can be permitted as allowable 
deduction under Section 36(1)(iii) of the Income-tax 
Act, 1961?"

2.	Our answer to the above-mentioned	question is squarely 
covered by our decision in favour of the assessee and against 
the Department in the case of Dy. Commr. of Income Tax, 
Ahmedabad v. M/s. Core Health Care Ltd. in Civil Appeal 
Nos.3952-55 of 2002.  

3.	Accordingly the above question is answered in favour of 
assessee and against the Department.  Consequently the 
Department's civil appeal is dismissed with no order as to 
cost.
