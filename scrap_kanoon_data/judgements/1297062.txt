CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4020 OF 2002

	This appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court dated 29/03/2001 
passed in MFA No.5093/1998(MVC).

	In a motor vehicle accident occurred in 1999, the appellant suffered bodily injuries.  
Pursuant to a claim petition preferred by the claimant, the Tribunal awarded 
Rs.3,70,500/- plus interest.  Being not satisfied, the claimant preferred an appeal before 
the High Court for enhancement of the awarded amount.  The respondent satisfied 
with the award did not filed any cross appeal.  Curiously enough, the High Court took 
up the appeal for enhancement of the award but reduced the awarded amount to 
Rs.1,00,000/- from Rs.3,70,500/-.  

	In our view, the procedure adopted by the High Court is unknown   to   the   law.   
The  order  of  the High Court is, 
.....2.

- 2 -

accordingly, set aside.  The award granted by the trial Court is restored.  The payment 
of the awarded amount along with the interest shall be made within three months from 
today.

	Appeal is allowed.
