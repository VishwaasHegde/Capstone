is needed in view of the findings arrived at by the courts below excepting that the direction

regarding payment of damages for the illegal occupation of the land from the date of occupation

till the land is vacated by the appellant shall be deleted. We order accordingly. The appeals are

disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.

       In view of the order now passed in these appeals, applications for initiating contempt

proceedings are also disposed of.
