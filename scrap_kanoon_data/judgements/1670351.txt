	Leave granted.
	We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order passed by the High Court of 
Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench, Lucknow by which the award passed by the Labour 
Court was affirmed with 25% of  back  wages.  Considering  the  facts  and circumstances of these 



cases, we are of the view that 25% of back wages shall not be allowed to be paid to the 
respondent. We order accordingly.  With this modification, the order of the High Court is 
affirmed.  The appeals are accordingly disposed of.  There shall be no order as to costs.
