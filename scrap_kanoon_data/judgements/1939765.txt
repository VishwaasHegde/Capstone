CIVIL APPEAL NO. 713 OF 2008
(@SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL)NO.1454 OF 2007)


		Leave granted.

		Heard both sides.
		The appellant herein has challenged the order passed by the High Court whereby the 
rent payable by the appellant/ petitioner was raised from Rs.1000/- to Rs.9000/- per month.  
By an order passed by this Court on 2.2.2007 we had stayed the interim order and we make it 
clear that the appellant/ petitioner shall be liable to pay only Rs.1000/- per month.  The said 
interim order dated 2.2.2007 will hold good till the Writ Petition No.30022/2006 pending 
before the High Court of Judicature of Allahabad is finally disposed of by the High Court.  We   
request   the   High Court to dispose of the Writ 


Petition pending before it at an early date at least within a period of six months.
		The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
