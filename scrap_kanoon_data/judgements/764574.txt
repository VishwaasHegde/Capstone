Bench: Tarun Chatterjee, Aftab Alam
                     IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
           CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

           CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2272 OF 2002



Manager, Moongalar Estate               ....Appellant

VERSUS

Chandra                               ....Respondent


                      ORDER

1.   Heard learned counsel for the appellant.

2.   No one appeared on behalf of the respondent

     although the respondent was duly served.

3.   This appeal arises out of a judgment of the High

     Court of Kerala at Ernakulam, by which, the appeal

     of the respondent was allowed and a sum of

     Rs.50,000/- was awarded to the widow of the

     deceased employee of the present appellant.

     Considering the facts and circumstances of the

     present case and the impugned judgment of the

     High Court, we are not inclined to interfere with the

     said Judgment of the High Court in the exercise of

                                                         1
             our discretionary powers under Article 136 of the

             Constitution of India.

        4.   Accordingly, the Civil Appeal is dismissed with no

             order as to costs. Interim order, if any, shall stand

             vacated.

        5.   However, we make it clear that the question of law

             involved in this appeal is kept open to be decided in

             appropriate case and dismissal of this appeal will

             not be treated as precedent in other similar cases.
