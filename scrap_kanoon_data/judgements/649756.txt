Teachers Training College in Laheriasarai.    They also appeared for     M.Ed.

respondent - Lalit Narain Mithila University. The counsel for the State stated

that the requisite approval was not granted.       The National Council for

Teacher Education (NCTE) has also stated that the recognition has not been

granted for this University. As the matter is pending for a long time, the

appropriate authority
                                     -2-



 of the Lalit Narain Mithila University may take a decision regarding the

 publication of the result, having regard to the various facts, within a period

 of two months. University may also consult the NCTE and the decision may

 be communicated to the appellants herein.

             The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
