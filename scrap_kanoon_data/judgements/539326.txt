             CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION


           CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5313 OF 2008
          (Arising out of SLP(C) No.21772/2008 (CC No.11258/2008)


M/S. TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION                                    PETITIONER(S)


                             Versus

 COMMNR. OF INCOME TAX                                           RESPONDENT (S)


                             JUDGMENT

 Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT,J.


      Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.

          Delay condoned.

          Leave granted.

          We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order of the High Court.

 The High Court has held that the Assessing Officer had disposed the proceedings

 stating the penalty proceedings initiated in this case u/s 271 C read with Section 274 of

 the Income Tax Act, 1961 are hereby dropped.       According to the High Court, there

 was no basis indicated for dropping the proceedings. The Tribunal referred to certain

 aspects and held that the initiation of proceedings under Section 263 of the Income

 Tax Act, 1961 (in short, the I.T.Act) was impermissible when considered in the

 background of the materials purportedly placed by the assessee before the Assessing

 Officer. What the High Court has done is to require the Assessing Officer to pass a




                                      -2-
reasoned order.    The High Court was of the view that Tribunal could not have

substituted its own reasonings which were required to be recorded by the Assessing

Officer. According to the assessee all relevant aspects were placed for consideration

and if the officer did not record reasons, assessee can not be faulted.

         We do not think it necessary to interfere at this stage. It goes without saying

that when the matter be taken up by the Assessing Officer on remand, it shall be his

duty to take into account all the relevant aspects including the materials, if any, already

placed by the assessee, and pass a reasoned order.

            The appeal is dismissed with the aforesaid observations.
