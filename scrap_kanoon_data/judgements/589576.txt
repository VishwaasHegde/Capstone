CRIMINAL  APPEAL NO.     374   OF 2008
(Arising out of SLP(Cr.)No. 4215/2006)

	
	Leave granted.	

	This appeal is directed against the order passed by   the High Court on 
the appellants' application under Sec.482 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure for quashing of the FIR No. 346 dated 13.5.2003, Police Station, 
Section-5 Panchkula, for the offences alleged to have been committed 
under Sec.406/498-A of the Indian Penal Code.  The said petition was filed 
on behalf of  five of the seven accused, and, as will appear from the order 
of the High Court impugned in this appeal, the same  was allowed in 
respect of petitioner Nos. 1 and 2, who are admittedly  residents of 
Nigeria, and petitioner No. 5 who is the uncle of the husband of the 
complainant. The petition was dismissed as far as the petitioner Nos. 3 
and 4, Subodh Kaura and his wife Sonia Kaura, are concerned.  It may be 
indicated that Sonia Kaura is the sister of the accused No.1 - husband of 
the complainant, and Subodh Kaura is her husband.	

-2-
	The High Court while considering the petition has dealt with the case 
made out on behalf of the petitioner Nos.1,2 and 5 but except for indicating 
that the FIR against the appellants herein would remain, no reason has 
been given as to why such order was required to be passed in respect of 
the appellants herein.

	Having heard learned counsel for the respective parties, we set aside the 
order of the High Court, as far as it dismisses the petition of the appellants 
under Sec.482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and remit the matter to 
the High Court for fresh consideration of the said petition after hearing the 
parties and in accordance with law.

-3-
	We make it clear that this order does not in any way amount to any 
expression on the merits of the matter.  

	The interim stay granted on 8.9.2006 by this Court will continue till the 
disposal of the matter by the High Court.

	The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
