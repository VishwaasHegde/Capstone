RAVEENDRAN, J.

	  These appeals are filed against the common judgment dated 
15.10.1999 passed by the High Court of Orissa in Misc. Appeal  
No.296/1998 filed by the respondents and Misc. Appeal No.198/1998 and 
Civil Revision No.109/1998 filed by the appellant.

2.	The appellant is stated to be legal heir and successor in interest of 
N.C. Budhraja (hereinafter referred to as the contractor). M/s. Orissa Mining 
Corporation Ltd. (for short OMC or respondent) entered into an agreement 
dated 16.9.1967 (Agreement No.30/F-2) for removal of over-burden at 
Kaliapani (Cuttack District) by excavation in all kinds of soil (including 
stoney earth and gravel mixed with boulders), and depositing/disposing of 
the same, as directed. The maximum lift was 6m including initial lift of one 
metre. The order to commence work was issued on 23.9.1967. Parties also 
entered into three supplementary agreements in regard to the said contract 
No.30/F-2, on 2.8.1969, 7.3.1970 and 10.2.1972. [Note : OMC had also 
entered into other contracts with the contractor including contract dated 
22.2.1968 (Contract No.2/F/2) for raising Chrome Ore by open excavation 
from the said mining area. We are not concerned with those contracts in 
these appeals]. 

3.	The main agreement enumerated two items of work in its schedule. 
The first, second, and third supplementary agreements enumerated 
respectively eight items, one item and four items in their respective 
schedules. The work was completed by the contractor on 15.6.1975. The 
final bill in respect of the work was prepared by OMC on 21.10.1976. It was 
revised in March-April 1977 by OMC. The final Bill It showed the total 
value of the work done (under several items in the schedule to main and 
three supplementary agreements) as Rs.1,49,190,76.74. The contractor 
countersigned the said bill on 14.4.1977 under protest, but, however, 
certified and confirmed that the measurements shown therein were correct.

4.	According to the contractor, having regard to the zig-zag route by 
which the over burden had to be carried, the actual lead was much longer 
and actual lift was much higher than what were stipulated in the agreement. 
He contended that the amounts shown as due for the work done was as per 
contract rates which was for removing overburden to the extent of lift and 
lead provided in the contract schedules; and at several places, he had to cut 
and remove the over-burden beyond the extent of lift and lead provided in 
the contract, and he should be paid for such extra leads and lifts. He claimed 
to have executed certain additional works not provided in the contract 
schedules, on the directions of OMC. He therefore represented that the 
matter may be examined and enquired into for determination of proper 
amounts due. In view of the several representations made by the contractor 
in respect of the contract no.30/F-2 as also other contracts, OMC sent the 
following letter dated 28.10.1978 to the contractor :-  
Re : Settlement of pending claims. 

You had called on Chairman, OMC, recently and apprised him of the dues 
receivable by you in respect of certain long pending matters such as mine 
benches work and raising at Kaliapani Quarry-I. In the matter of Kaliapani 
it has been decided to constitute a committee which will go separately into 
your claims and other facts, in which connection you are requested to give 
all possible help and assistance, so that your dues, if any, will be 
ascertainable.

In regard to other pending matters, you had indicated yourself that you 
will give the details of claims and payment received by you. This may be 
given within a day or two so as to enable OMC to settle up the above at 
the earliest.


5.	The contractor sent a reply dated 16.11.1978 enclosing therewith a 
statement quantifying his claims relating to contract no. 30F-2 (subject 
matter of these appeals) as also another contract (no. 2F-2). A Committee 
was constituted by OMC to scrutinize and recommend on the admissibility 
of the claims made by the contractor in regard to Agreement No.30/F-2 and 
Agreement No.2/F-2. Several meetings were held by the said Committee and 
the claims of the contractor aggregating to Rs.50,15,820 in regard to contract 
no.30.F2 were considered. Ultimately the Committee submitted a final 
report dated 7.12.1979 expressing the view that the contractor could be paid 
only a sum of Rs.3,52,916/- in regard to his claims in respect of the two 
contracts. The contractor, thereafter, wrote a letter dated 29.2.1980 stating 
that he had come to know that the Committee had submitted its final report 
and requested for a copy of the report and for payments of the amounts due. 
OMC sent a reply dated 4.3.1980 stating that the claims were not accepted 
yet but however agreed to release a sum of Rs.3.5 lakhs and released the said 
sum on that day. 

6.	The contractor sent a notice dated 4.6.1980 invoking the Arbitration 
Agreement (Clause 23) in respect of pending claims relating to Contract No. 
30F-2 and two other contracts. He suggested a panel of names and requested 
OMC to appoint one of them as Arbitrator. Immediately, thereafter, the 
contractor filed Misc. Case No.306/80 in regard to the contract in the Court 
of the Sub-Judge, Bhubaneswar, under section 8(2) of Arbitration Act, 1940 
(Act for short) for appointment of an Arbitrator. The court allowed the said 
petition by order dated 6.10.1980 appointing Mr. Justice Balakrishna Patro, 
a retired Judge of the Orissa High Court as Arbitrator by consent. On 
16.12.1982, an application was made by the present appellant under Order 
22 Rule 3 CPC claiming to be the son of legatee of the contractor and for 
substituting him in place of the deceased N.C. Budhraja, as his legal heir. 
The said application was allowed by the court on 15.11.1985. In the 
meanwhile, Arbitration Act, 1940 ('Act' for short) was amended by the 
Arbitration (Orissa Amendment) Act, 1984, inserting section 41A providing 
for constitution of and reference to the Arbitration Tribunal. By Notification 
dated 3.5.1986, (amended by Memo dated 23.6.1986) the State Government 
constituted a one Member Special Arbitral Tribunal with Justice N. K. Das 
as Arbitral Tribunal to settle the disputes between the contractor and OMC 
in regard to contract no. 30/F-2. 

7.	The contractor filed a claim statement dated 27.6.1986 before the 
arbitrator praying for an award of Rs.3,41,42,040 with interest from 
1.6.1986, as detailed below :

      Value of work done by the contractor		 		: Rs.2,45,85,183.89

      Less: 	Amounts paid by OMC to the 
         		Contractor				        		: Rs.1,49,88,566.90	     

Balance due :	(Rs.95,96,616.99) rounded off as		 : Rs.  95,96,616.00

      Add: 	Interest on the said amounts
         		from the respective dates  	: Rs.2,40,09,948.00

      Add: 	Interest on belated 
      Payments       			: Rs.      5,35,476.00	  Rs. 2,45,45,424.00
		               						_________________         
			  	
		Total				        		: 	Rs.3,41,42,040.00	
									_________________

In the claim statement filed before the arbitrator, the nature and quantum of 
claim made was different from what was claimed in the letter dated 
16.11.1978 which was considered by the Committee. In the claim statement 
the contractor abandoned claims to an extent of Rs.21,83,692 out of the 
claim of Rs.50,15,820/- made on 16.11.1978 and claimed only Rs.26,32,128 
from the original claim. The balance of the claim was fresh claims, not made 
earlier. The claim of Rs.95,96,616 made before the arbitrator was made up 
of two parts, first being a part of the original claim made in the letter dated 
16.11.1978 and the second being completely fresh claims made for the first 
time in the claim statement, as detailed below :
(i) Out of the original claim of Rs.50,15,820 made 		           Rs. 28,32,128	
     in the letter dated 16.11.1978 (The claim for balance  
     of Rs.21,83,692 not pursued in arbitration)

(ii) Fresh claims not made earlier					Rs. 67,64,488

								
(Note : As per actual calculations, the total of the claims made by the appellant was 
Rs.96,66,107 and the new claims were Rs.68,33,979].

8.	The Arbitrator made a reasoned award dated 28.11.1986 holding that 
the appellant was entitled to a sum of Rs.1,02,66,901.36 (which was more 
than the claim of Rs.95,96,616) with interest at 12% per annum from 
1.8.1977 till date of award, and future interest at the rate of 6% P.A. from 
the expiry of one month from the date of the award till date of decree. The 
award is in respect of 35 claims. Out of 35 claims, Items 1 to 16 related to 
the schedule items of work under the contract (main agreement and the 
supplementary agreement 1 to 3). Items 17 to 34 were in respect of work 
which did not form part of the contract schedule. Claim 35 related to 
escalation in cost of labour and material on account of delay in execution. 

8.1)	The details of the items 1 to 16, (that is description of work, total 
amount claimed, amount admitted, difference in dispute and amount 
awarded) are as under  :

Though in the claim statement, the appellant had clearly stated that he had in 
all received Rs.149,88,566/90, and given credit for the said sum, during the 
hearing, the appellant contended that instead of Rs.149,88,566/90, he had 
appropriated only Rs.120,01,695/90 towards this contract and that the 
balance of Rs.29,86,871/- had been adjusted towards some other contacts. 
Even though the claim statement was not amended, the Arbitrator proceeded 
on that basis and awarded Rs.32,83,243 in respect of items 1 to 16 as under : 

A.  Total amount claimed for Items 1 to 16			Rs. 153,16,507.00

8.3)	The last item of claim of the appellant, namely item No.35 was for 
Rs.22,17,188/34 as escalation in cost between 1972 and 1975 on account of 
increase in cost of labour and material, based on the General Price Index. 
The Arbitrator determined the value of work executed after 1.4.1973 as 
Rs.52,96,967/-. He awarded an escalation of 32.6% on the said value of 
work and awarded Rs.17,26,811.00 as escalation in cost of labour and 
material. 

8.4)	Thus the Arbitrator awarded Rs.102,66,901.66 to the appellant as 
detailed below (exclusive of interest), as against the claim of Rs.95,96,616/- 
(exclusive of interest) made by the appellant : 

(i)	Amounts award in respect of claims 1 to 16			Rs.32,83,243.00
(ii)	Amounts awarded in respect of claims 17 to 34 		Rs.52,56,847.36
	(as against claim of Rs.70,56,573/55)

(iii)	Amount awarded in respect of claim 35 as escalation 	Rs. 17,26,811.00
	(as against claim of Rs.22,17,188/34)				_______________
				Total award				Rs.102,66,901.36
									_____________

9.	The contractor filed OS No.224/1986 for making the award rule of the 
court, on the file of the Civil Judge, Sr. Division, Bhubaneswar. The   
objections to the said award filed by OMC were registered as Misc. Case 
No.5/1987. The said court, by common judgment dated 21.3.1998, overruled 
the objections and directed that the award of the arbitrator be made the rule 
of the court and a decree be drawn in terms of the award. 

10.	Feeling aggrieved, OMC filed Misc. Appeal No.296/1998, 
challenging the decision of the Civil Judge refusing to set aside the award, 
directing a decree in terms of the award. The contractor filed Misc. Appeal 
No.198/1998 and Civil Revision No.109/1998 claiming future interest from 
the date of decree as the judgment of the Civil Judge was silent on that 
aspect. 	The High Court heard and disposed of the said appeals and 
revision petition by common judgment 15.10.1999. It allowed Misc. Appeal 
No.296/1998 filed by OMC and dismissed M.A. No.198/1998 and C.R. 
No.109/1998 filed by the contractor. The High Court held :

(i) 	The claim of the contractor was barred by limitation and therefore the 
award was liable to be set aside.

(ii) 	The arbitrator acted beyond his jurisdiction in awarding huge  
amounts towards alleged extra work, even though there was nothing 
to indicate that conditions contemplated in proviso to Clause 11 
(relating to additional work) were satisfied.

(iii)	Though the award purported to be a reasoned award, the award in 
regard to Items 17, 18, 19 and 25 to 27 was not supported by any 
reason and therefore, the award was liable to be set aside. 

(iv) 	The award in respect of escalation in cost (item 35) at the rate of 
32.6% of the value of work was without basis, (when the claim itself 
was for a lesser rate), in the absence of any provision in the contract 
for escalation, amounted to legal misconduct. 

(v)	The award being in excess of the claim made by the contractor 
shocked the judicial conscience of the court. 

(vi)	Interest could have been awarded by the arbitrator only from the date 
of reference (6.10.1980) and could not be awarded in regard to any 
pre-reference period. 

(vii)	Though in the normal course, some of the issues would have 
necessitated remitting the matter to the arbitrator for fresh 
consideration, it was not necessary to remit the matter as the entire 
award was being set aside on the ground of limitation. 

The said decision of the High Court is challenged by the appellant in this 
appeal by special leave. 
11.	On the contentions urged, the following questions arise for 
consideration :

(i) 	Whether the claim made before the arbitrator or any part thereof  was 
barred by limitation?

(ii) 	Whether the award is liable to be set aside on the ground of legal 
misconduct and the error apparent on the face of the award?

(iii) 	Whether the award is liable to be set aside on the ground that the 
arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction ?

(iv) 	To what relief the parties are entitled?

Questions (i) and (ii) :

12.	The Arbitrator held that the claims were not barred. He held :

"In the case of a suit, the date on which the cause of action arises is the 
date from which the limitation period starts. Under section 20, it is the 
date on which the right to apply accrues that determines the starting point. 
That starting point does not coincide with the date on which the cause of 
action for filing a suit arises. The same principle would apply to an 
application under section 8 of the Act.  The claimant signed the final 
bill on 14.4.1977 under protest. It is not correct to say that the claimant 
accepted the final bill.  All these factors show that negotiation was 
going on and the matter was in a nebulous and fluid stage. The committee 
gave its report in December, 1979. In March, 1980 some portion out of the 
money said to have been found due by the committee was paid on ad hoc 
basis. Notice was given by the contractor on 14.6.80. So, the dispute as to 
final bill still continues. Till the final bill is prepared and accepted by the 
contractor, limitation would not accrue. When the matter went to court in 
1980, it was not barred by limitation"       

13.	The High Court found that the work was completed on 15.6.1975, 
final measurement was taken on 16.6.1975 and the final bill was signed by 
the contractor under protest on 14.4.1977 and therefore held that the cause of 
action for the contractor to make a claim arose on 14.4.1977. According to 
the High Court, as the notice invoking arbitration was issued on 4.6.1980 
and the petition under section 8(2) of the Act was filed thereafter, beyond 
three years from 14.4.1977, the entire claim was barred by limitation. The 
High Court further held that as the final bill was signed under protest by the 
contractor, it could be said that the cause of action arose on a date 
subsequent to the date of signing of the final bill. It further held that the fact 
that the Departmental Committee considered the claims in 1979, subsequent 
to the signing of the final bill under protest, did not have the effect of 
saving/extending limitation in the absence of any acknowledgement in 
writing as required under section 18 of the Act.

14.	Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963 deals with effect of 
acknowledgement in writing. Sub-section (1) thereof provides that where, 
before the expiration of the prescribed period for a suit or application in 
respect of any right, an acknowledgement of liability in respect of such right 
has been made in writing  signed by the party against whom such right is 
claimed, a fresh period of limitation shall be computed from the time when 
the acknowledgement was so signed. The explanation  to the section 
provides that an acknowledgement may be sufficient though it omits to 
specify the exact nature of the right or avers that the time for payment has 
not yet come or is accompanied by a refusal to pay, or is coupled with a 
claim to set off, or is addressed to a person other than a person entitled to the 
right. Interpreting section 19 of the Limitation Act, 1908 (corresponding to 
section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963) this Court in Shapur Fredoom 
Mazda v. Durga Prosad Chamaria (AIR 1961 SC 1236), held :  

 acknowledgement as prescribed by section 19 merely renews debt; it 
does not create a new right of action. It is a mere acknowledgement of the 
liability in respect of the right in question; it need not be accompanied by a 
promise to pay either expressly or even by implication. 

The statement on which a plea of acknowledgement is based must relate to 
a present subsisting liability though the exact nature or the specific 
character of the said liability may not be indicated in words. Words used 
in the acknowledgement must, however, indicate the existence of jural 
relationship between the parties such as that of debtor and creditor, and it 
must appear that the statement is made with the intention to admit such 
jural relationship. Such intention can be inferred by implication from the 
nature of the admission, and need not be expressed in words. If the 
statement is fairly clear, then the intention to admit jural relationship may 
be implied from it. The admission in question need not be express but 
must be made in circumstances and in words from which the court can 
reasonably infer that the person making the admission intended to refer to 
a subsisting liability as at the date of the statement. Stated generally, 
courts lean in favour of a liberal construction of such statements though it 
does not mean that where no admission is made one should be inferred, or 
where a statement was made clearly without intending to admit the 
existence of jural relationship such intention could be fastened on the 
maker of the statement by an involved or far-fetched process of 
reasoning. 

In construing words used in the statements made in writing on which a 
plea of acknowledgement rests oral evidence has been expressly excluded 
but surrounding circumstances can always be considered.  The effect of 
the words used in a particular document must inevitably depend upon the 
context in which the words are used and would always be conditioned by 
the tenor of the said document..  

15.	It is now well settled that a writing to be an acknowledgement of 
liability must involve an admission of a subsisting jural relationship between 
the parties and a conscious affirmation of an intention of continuing such 
relationship in regard to an existing liability. The admission need not be in 
regard to any precise amount nor by expressed words.  If a defendant writes 
to the plaintiff requesting him to send his claim for verification and payment, 
it amounts to an acknowledgement. But if the defendant merely says,  
without admitting liability, it would like to examine the claim or the 
accounts, it may not amount to acknowledgement. In other words, a writing, 
to be treated as an acknowledgement of liability should consciously admit 
his liability to pay or admit his intention to pay the debt. Let us illustrate. If  
a creditor sends a demand notice demanding payment of Rs.1 lakh due under 
a promissory note executed by the debtor and the debtor sends a reply stating 
that he would pay the amount due, without mentioning the amount, it will 
still be an acknowledgement of liability. If a writing is relied on as an 
acknowledgement for extending the period of limitation in respect of the 
amount or right claimed in the suit, the acknowledgement should necessarily 
be in respect of the subject matter of the suit. If a person executes a work 
and issues a demand letter making a claim for the amount due as per the 
final bill and the defendant agrees to verify the bill and pay the amount, the 
acknowledgement will save limitation for a suit for recovery of only such 
bill amount, but will not extend the limitation in regard to any fresh or 
additional claim for damages made in the suit, which was not a part of the 
bill or the demand letter. Again we may illustrate. If a house is constructed 
under the item rate contract and the amount due in regard to work executed 
is Rs. two lakhs and certain part payments say aggregating to Rs.1,25,0000/- 
have been made and the contractor demands payment of the balance of 
Rs.75,000/- due towards the bill and the employer acknowledges liability, 
that acknowledgement will be only in regard to the sum of Rs.75,000/- 
which is due. If the contractor files a suit for recovery of the said Rs.75,000/- 
due in regard to work done and also for recovery of Rs.50,000/- as damages 
for breach by the employer and the said suit is filed beyond three years from 
completion of work and submission of the bill but within three years from 
the date of acknowledgement, the suit will be saved from bar of limitation 
only in regard to the liability that was acknowledged namely Rs.75,000/- and 
not in regard to the fresh or additional claim of Rs.50,000/- which was not 
the subject matter of acknowledgement. What can be acknowledged is a 
present subsisting liability. An acknowledgment made with reference to a 
liability, cannot extend limitation for a time barred liability or a claim that 
was not made at the time of acknowledgment or some other liability relating 
to other transactions. Any admission of jural relationship in regard to the 
ascertained sum due or a pending claim, cannot be an acknowledgement for 
a new additional claim for damages. 

16.	We   will   now   examine   this   case    with   reference   to   the   said 
principles. In this case,  the cause of action accrued on 14.4.1977 when the 
final bill was signed by the contractor. It is not in dispute that the final bill 
showed that a sum of Rs.17,69,608.73 was payable to the contractor (after 
giving credit to the payments made and after withholding a sum of 
Rs.7,45,953.83 as 5% security deposit). Towards the said sum of 
Rs.17,69,608.73. Rs.17 lacs was paid on 25.2.1976 and Rs.70,000/- was paid 
on 6.8.1977. The contractor had made some claims and OMC wrote a letter 
dated 28.10.1978 in regard to the pending claims of the contractor. In regard 
to Kaliapani matters, OMC informed the contractor that it has been decided 
to constitute a Committee which will go into the claims of the contractor so 
that the dues, if any, could be ascertained. It further stated that on the details 
of the claims and payments received being given to the contractor, OMC 
will settle up the pending matters at the earliest. This clearly showed an 
intention on the part of OMC to admit the jural relationship of contractor and 
employer and an intention to settle the pending claims after being satisfied 
about them. Therefore, the letter dated 28.10.1978 was clearly an 
acknowledgement in writing in so far as the pending claims of the 
contractor. What were the pending claims is made clear in the letter dated 
16.11.1978 written by the contractor enclosing a statement showing that in 
all, a sum of Rs.50,15,820/- was due. The Committee constituted by the 
OMC examined these claims and admitted the claims only to an extent of 
Rs.3,52,916/- as per its final report dated 7.12.1979. OMC paid  
Rs.3,50,000/- on 4.3.1980. In view of the acknowledgement in writing on 
28.10.1978 and payment of the Rs.3,50,000/- on 4.3.1980, it can be said that 
in regard to the pending claims of the contractor, the limitation stood 
extended by three years from 4.3.1980 and at all events by three years from 
28.10.1978. It is not in dispute that the contractor issued the notice invoking 
arbitration on 4.6.1980 and immediately filed a petition under section 8(2) of 
the Act for appointment of Arbitrator which was allowed on 6.10.1980. 
Therefore, whatever claims were made before the Arbitrator which was part 
of the claim of Rs.50,15,820, was within time, having been made within 
three years from 28.10.1978 and 4.6.1980.

17.	In regard to the claims aggregating to Rs.95,96,616/- made in the 
claim statement filed before the Arbitrator, only claims aggregating to 
Rs.28,32,138 related to and formed part of the said pending claim of 
Rs.50,15,820. The appellant did not make a claim in regard to the remaining 
Rs.21,83,692. Therefore, out of the claim of Rs.95,96,616 made by the 
appellant before the Arbitrator, the claim for only Rs.28,32,138/- was not 
barred by limitation. The remaining claims of the appellant aggregating to 
Rs.67,64,488/- out of the total of Rs.95,96,616/- being fresh claims, were not 
pending claims in respect of which the acknowledgement was made. 
Therefore the said fresh claims aggregating to Rs.67,64,488 made for the 
first time in the claims statement filed on 27.6.1986 were clearly barred by 
limitation.

18.	The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the limitation 
would begun to run from the date on which a difference arose between the 
parties, and in this case the difference arose only when OMC refused to 
comply with the notice dated 4.6.1980 seeking reference to arbitration. We 
are afraid, the contention is without merit. The appellant is obviously 
confusing the limitation for a petition under section 8(2) of the Arbitration 
Act, 1940 with the limitation for the claim itself. The limitation for a suit is 
calculated as on the date of filing of the suit. In the case of arbitration, 
limitation for the claim is to be calculated on the date on which the 
arbitration is deemed to have commenced. Section 37(3) of the Act provides 
that for the purpose of Limitation Act, an arbitration is deemed to have been 
commenced when one party to the arbitration agreement serves on the other 
party thereto, a notice requiring the appointment of an arbitrator. Such a 
notice having been served on 4.6.1980, it has to be seen whether the claims 
were in time as on that date. If the claims were barred on 4.6.1980, it follows 
that the claims had to be rejected by the arbitrator on the ground that the 
claims were barred by limitation. The said period has nothing to do with the 
period of limitation for filing a petition under section 8(2) of the Act. Insofar 
as a petition under section 8(2), the cause of action would arise when the 
other party fails to comply with the notice invoking arbitration. Therefore, 
the period of limitation for filing a petition under section 8(2) seeking 
appointment of an arbitrator cannot be confused with the period of limitation 
for making a claim. The decisions of this Court in Inder Singh Rekhi vs. 
Delhi Development Authority - (1988) 2 SCC 338, Panchu Gopal Bose vs. 
Board of Trustees for Port of Calcutta - (1993) 4 SCC 338 and Utkal 
Commercial Corporation vs. Central Coal Fields - (1999) 2 SCC 571 also 
make this position clear. 

19.	The appellant next contended, relying on section 18 of Limitation Act, 
that as there was acknowledgement of liability in regard to Contract 
No.30/F-2 in the letter dated 28.10.1978, and the notice invoking arbitration 
was issued on 4.6.1980 within 3 years from 28.10.1978, he was at liberty to 
make any claim in regard to the contract before the arbitrator, (even though 
such claims had not been earlier made) and all such claims shall have to be 
treated as being within the period of limitation. Such a contention cannot be 
countenanced. As noticed above, the cause of action arose on 14.4.1977. But 
for the acknowledgement on 28.10.1978, on the date of invoking arbitration 
(4.6.1980), the claims would have been barred by time as being beyond the 
period of limitation. The limitation is extended only in regard to the liability 
which was acknowledged in the letter dated 28.10.1978. It is not in dispute 
that either on 28.10.1978 or on 4.3.1980, the contractor had not made the 
fresh claims aggregating to Rs.67,64,488  and the question of such claims 
made in future for the first time on 27.6.1986, being acknowledged by OMC 
on 28.10.1998 did not arise. 

20.	Another aspect requires to be noticed. The contractor was 
N.C.Budhraja. The original claim (which was the subject matter of letter 
dated 28.10.1978, subjected to examination by the Committee as per report 
dated 7.12.1979, and towards which Rs.3,50,000/- was paid) made by the 
contractor N.C. Budhraja aggregated to Rs.50,15,820. The Appellant who is 
his LR cannot for the first time make a fresh claim before the Arbitrator, 
which was never made by N.C. Budhraja. The Appellant could only pursue 
the claim made by N.C. Budhraja, which were pending or subsisting when 
N.C. Budhraja issued the notice dated 4.6.1980

21.	The arbitrator committed an error apparent on the face of the record 
and a legal misconduct in holding that the entire claim was within time. His 
assumption that if the application filed by the contractor in 1980 under 
section 8(2) of Arbitration Act for appointment of an Arbitrator was in time, 
all claims made in the claim statement filed before the Arbitrator appointed 
in such proceeding under section 8(2) are also in time, is patently erroneous 
and is an error apparent on the face of the record. The reasoning of the 
arbitrator that on account of the formation of the Committee by OMC to 
scrutinize the pending claims in pursuance of the OMC's letter dated 
28.10.1978, and the payment of Rs.3,50,000/- on 4.3.1980 in pursuance of 
the Committee giving its final report on 7.12.1979, every claim of the 
contract including new claims which were made for the first time in the 
claim statement filed in 1986 (as contrasted with 'pending claims' considered 
by OMC), are not barred by limitation, is also an error apparent in the face 
of the award. Under section 18 an acknowledgement in writing extends the 
limitation. Under section 19 a payment made on account of a debt, enables a 
fresh  period of limitation being computed. Therefore, the letter of OMC 
dated 28.10.1978 and the payment of Rs.3,50,000/- by OMC, would result in 
a fresh period of limitation being computed only in regard to the 'existing 
debt' in respect of which acknowledgment and payment was made. 
Admittedly, as at that time, the claim of the contractor was only for a sum of 
Rs.50,15,820. Therefore, the letter dated 28.10.1978 and payment on 
4.3.1980 extended the limitation only in respect of the claims which were 
part of the said claim of Rs.50,15,820. Therefore, the fresh claims of 
Rs.67,64,488/- (out of the total claim of Rs.95,96,616) is barred by 
limitation and the award made in that behalf is liable to be set aside. 
Consequently, we hold that only that part of the claim before the Arbitrator 
which was part of the claim of Rs.5015,820/- made by the contractor, that 
was existing or pending as on 28.10.1978 and 4.3.1980, namely 
Rs.28,32,128 (out of Rs.95,96,616) could have been considered by the 
Arbitrator. 

Question (iii) &amp; (iv) :

22.	In the claim statement filed before the arbitrator the appellant showed 
the value of work done as Rs.2,45,85,183.89 and the total payments made by 
OMC as Rs.149,88,566.90. Thus he claimed the balance due as 
Rs.95,96,616. Even while calculating the interest on the amount outstanding, 
the claimant proceeded on the basis that he has received in all, 
Rs.1,49,88,566.90 from OMC. The prayer before the arbitrator in the claim 
statement was for the award of Rs.95,96,616 in regard to the work done after 
giving credit of Rs.1,49,88,566.90. The categorical stand of the contractor 
and the appellant all along has been that OMC had paid in all a sum of 
Rs.149,88,566.90. But during the course of the arbitration proceedings, the 
appellant contended that out of Rs.149,88,566.90 received from OMC and 
taken into credit towards this contract, a sum of Rs.29,86,871/- was being 
appropriated towards other contracts and therefore the payments made by 
OMC towards this contract should be taken as Rs.120,01,695.90. The 
arbitrator has mechanically accepted the said altered stand contrary to the 
claim statement and proceeded to determine the amount payable by OMC, 
by taking the amount paid by OMC as Rs.120,01,659.90 towards this 
contract, even though the claim statement showing that OMC had paid  
Rs.149,88,566.90 remained unaltered. The claim statement was not amended 
to show that only Rs.120,01,659.90 had been received from OMC in regard 
to the contract. When the claim made in the claim statement is after 
adjusting Rs.149,88,566.90 paid by OMC towards the work, the arbitrator 
cannot proceed on the basis that only Rs.120,01,659.90 was paid towards the 
work. As a result though the Arbitrator found that the amount payable 
towards claims at Items 1 to 16 was only Rs.365,862.18, he awarded 
Rs.32,83,243/- to the appellant, thereby increasing the liability of OMC by 
Rs.29,86,871/-. By awarding more than what was claimed in the claim 
statement (by showing a lesser amount as having been paid by OMC though 
claim statement showed a higher amount), the Arbitrator clearly exceeded 
his jurisdiction. The Arbitrator thus committed a legal misconduct and the 
award to that extent is  liable to be set aside. Therefore the amount awarded 
in respect of claims at items 1 to 16 by the Arbitrator is to be reduced by 
Rs.29,86,871/-. 

23.	The Arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction in another respect. The 
total claim made by the contractor before the Arbitration was Rs.95,96,616/- 
(excluding interest). But the amount awarded by the arbitrator towards the 
said claim was Rs.1,02,66,901/36 (excluding interest). Making an award in 
excess of the claim itself by Rs.6,70,285 is a clear act of exceeding the 
jurisdiction and amounts to a legal misconduct and to that extent of 
Rs.6,70,285/- the award is invalid. 

23.	In regard to item 35, that is escalation in cost, the claim in the claim 
statement was at the rate of 15% for the value of work done in 1972-73, 
28.5% in respect of value of work done in 1973-74 and 32% in respect of 
work done in 1974-75. But the Arbitrator has awarded escalation at a flat 
rate of 32.6% on the entire cost of work done from 1.4.1973 and thereby 
awarded an escalation in excess of what was claimed. This also amounts to 
exceeding the jurisdiction and therefore legal misconduct. The award in 
excess of what was claimed was invalid. 

25.	The award of the arbitrator in respect of time barred claim of 
Rs.67,64,488 is an error apparent on the face of the award. Award of 
amounts in excess of claim (referred to in paras 22, 23 and 24) clearly 
amount to exceeding the jurisdiction. All these, that is awarding amount 
towards time barred part of the claim of Rs.67,64,488, and awarding 
amounts of Rs.29,86,871, Rs.670,285 and escalation in cost at a rate more 
than what is claimed, are all legal misconducts and the award in regard to 
those amounts are null and void. There is however some overlapping of the 
aforesaid amounts.

26.	Does it mean that the entire award should be set aside? The answer is 
no. That part of the award which is valid and separable can be upheld. That 
part relates to the claims which  were validly before the Arbitrator, which 
were part of the existing or pending claims of Rs.50,15,820 and which were 
not barred by limitation. As stated above they were the claims which were 
existing or pending in 1978, 1979 and 1980 (considered by the committee 
and payment made by OMC) which were carried before the Arbitrator to an 
extent of Rs.28,32,128. Only the amounts awarded by the Arbitrator against 
those claims can be considered as award validly made in Arbitration, falling 
within jurisdiction. They are clearly severable from the other portions of the 
award. The particulars of the claims and corresponding awards are as

13,93,373.50

[Note : The figures shown by (*) in the column 'Award by Arbitrator', refer 
to the maximum that could have been awarded by the Arbitrator having 
regard to claim that was not barred by limitation]. 

Thus the total amount awarded by the Arbitrator against claims which were 
not barred by limitation was only Rs.13,93,373.50. The award to this extent 
is not open to challenge. This part of the award does not suffer from any 
legal misconduct. There is also no error apparent on the face of the award in 
respect of the amount. It is not open to challenge. 

27.	The scope of interference is limited. In Hindustan Construction Co. 
Ltd. vs. Governor of Orissa - (1995) 3 SCC 8, this Court held : 
"It is well known that the court while considering the question whether the 
award should be set aside, does not examine that question as an appellant 
court. While exercising the said power, the court cannot reappreciate all 
the materials on the record for the purpose of recording a finding whether 
in the facts and circumstances of a particular case the award in question 
could have been made. Such award can be set aside on any of the grounds 
specified in section 30 of the Act." 

In Hindustan Tea Co. vs. M/s K. Sashikant &amp; Co. - 1986 (Supp.) SCC 506, 
this Court observed thus : 
"The Award is reasoned one. The objections which have been raised 
against the Award are such that they cannot indeed be taken into 
consideration within the limited ambit of challenge admissible under the 
scheme of the Arbitration Act. Under the law, the Arbitrator is made the 
final arbiter of the dispute between the parties. The award is not open to 
challenge on the ground that the Arbitrator has reached a wrong 
conclusion or has failed to appreciate facts." 

Therefore, the Award of the Arbitrator has to be upheld to an extent of   
Rs.13,93,373.50. 

28.	In view of the foregoing, we allow these appeals in part, set aside the 
judgment of the High Court and direct a decree in terms of the award for a 
sum of Rs.13,93,373.50 with interest at the rate of 12% P.A. from 1.8.1977 
to date of award (28.11.1986) and at the rate of 6% P.A. thereafter, that is 
from 29.11.1986 till date of payment. Parties to bear their respective costs.
