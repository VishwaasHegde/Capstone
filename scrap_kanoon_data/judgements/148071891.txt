                           CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION


                              CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5039 OF 2008
                            [Arising out of SLP(C) No. 15936/2006]


YOGENDER CHAND AND ANR.                                                      ...   PETITIONER(S)
                                          :VERSUS:

UNITED INDIA INSURANCE CO. LTD. AND ORS.                                     ...   RESPONDENT(S)


                                          ORDER

             Leave granted.

             Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that
    keeping in view the fact that the Insurance Company has already deposited the entire
    amount awarded and had initiated a separate proceeding for recovery thereof from
    the owner of the vehicle, it was not necessary for the High Court to direct the
    appellant also to deposit the awarded amount. The impugned order is, therefore, set
    aside.
             However, the recovery proceedings initiated by the Insurance Company
    against the owner of the vehicle shall continue.
             We request the High Court to consider the desirability of disposing of the
    appeal preferred by the appellant as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a
    period of six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

             The appeal is disposed of on the above terms.

                                                   ..........................J
