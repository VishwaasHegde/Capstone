                            O R D E R

         Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after going through the impugned

judgment, we find that the Division Bench of the High Court while disposing of Letters Patent

Appeal under Clause 10 of the Letters Patent, did not pass a speaking order. In that view of the

matter, the impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside and the matter is remitted back to the

Division Bench of the High Court for passing a speaking and reasoned order in accordance with

law. The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above. There shall be no order as to costs.

       In view of the order now passed in this appeal, application for intervention is also disposed

of.
