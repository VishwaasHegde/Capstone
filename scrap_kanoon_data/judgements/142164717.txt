                                O R D E R

     1.   Leave granted.

     2.   This appeal is directed against the judgment and

          final order passed by the High Court of Punjab

          and   Haryana    at   Chandigarh     in   Regular    Second

          Appeal No. 4174 of 2002, by which the second

          appeal filed by the appellants was dismissed as

          the   High   Court    did   not    find   any   substantial

          question of law to be decided in the aforesaid

          second appeal.

1
                                             2
    3.   In our view, this appeal can be decided on a very

         short question.         The trial court as well as the

         appellate court and finally the High Court in the

         second appeal dismissed the suit filed by the

         plaintiffs/appellants for declaration challenging

         the sale deed dated 29th of May, 1989, executed by

         the     respondent      Nos.     1      to   3      in    favour    of

         respondent       Nos.     9    and      10   as      well    as    the

         compromise (Exhibit No. C1) dated 7th of April,

         1986 in a suit title Ujagar Singh vs. Puran

         Singh, But it is an admitted position that before

         the     High     Court,       the       appellants        filed     an

         application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of

         Civil    Procedure      for     acceptance          of    additional

         evidence, namely, documents such as certificate
         of    Military    service,      voter        list    of     concerned

         assembly segment for the year 1982, receipt of

         house    tax     1988-89,      payment        of     chaowkdra      of

         khariff 1986, rabi 1990, rabi 1991, khariff 1992,

         identity card issued by Election Commission of

         India, Ration Card etc.



    4.   While deciding the second appeal, however, the

         High Court had failed to take notice of the

         application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of
2
                                        3

         Civil    Procedure      and   decide      whether   additional

         evidence could be permitted to be admitted into

         evidence.       In our view, when an application for

         acceptance of additional evidence under Order 41

         Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure was filed

         by the appellants, it was the duty of the High

         Court to deal with the same on merits. That being

         the     admitted       position,     we     have    no   other

         alternative but to set aside the judgment of the

         High Court and remit the appeal back to it for a

         decision afresh in the second appeal along with

         the     application     for   acceptance      of    additional

         evidence in accordance with law.


    5.   For the reasons aforesaid, the impugned Judgment

         is set aside.         The appeal is thus allowed to the
         extent indicated above.            There will be no order

         as to costs.


    6.   We make it clear that we have not gone into the

         merits     as    to     whether    the     application    for

         acceptance of additional evidence under Order 41

         Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure should be

         allowed or not, which shall be decided by the

         High Court at the time of decision of the second

         appeal in accordance with law.              We also make it
3
                                      4

         clear that we have not gone into the merits of

         the second appeal which shall also be decided by

         the High Court along with the application under

         Order 41 Rule 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

         Considering the facts and circumstances of the

         case, we request the High Court to dispose of the

         second appeal at an early date preferably within

         six months from the date of supply of a copy of

         this order to it.


    7.   In view of the order passed in C.A.No. of 2008 @

         SLP)No.18759 of 2006, Contempt Petition ) No.57

         of 2008 is    disposed of.


    8.   In view of our decision in the appeal itself, we

         do   not     feel   inclined     to    entertain       the
         Interlocutory Application filed by the petitioner

         during when the matter was kept for Judgment.

         Accordingly, the said application for interim

         direction is disposed of as infructuous.
