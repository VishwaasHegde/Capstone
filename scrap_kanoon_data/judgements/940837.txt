          Eshwarappa&amp; Anr.                        ...Appellants

          VERSUS

          Vishalakshamma &amp; Ors.                 ...Respondents


                                     ORDER

          1.    Leave granted.


2.   These appeals are directed against the order dated 5th of

     August, 2005 passed by the High Court of Karnataka at

     Bangalore in M.F.A. Nos.4120 &amp; 4121 of 2003 by which the

     order of the trial court granting injunction was set aside and

     the application for temporary injunction filed by the plaintiff

     was rejected.

3.   On 30th of September, 2005, this Court while issuing notice

     passed the following order :-


                                                                  1
"Issue notice.

In the meantime, status quo shall be maintained."

4.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties

and after going through the materials on record and

considering the fact that the interim order of status quo

was granted which is still continuing, we are of the view

that these appeals shall be disposed of by directing that

the interim order of status quo granted by this Court

shall continue for a period of another one year from the

date of supply of a copy of this order and in the

meantime, the trial court shall dispose of the suit without

granting any unnecessary adjournments to either of the

parties. We make it clear that we have not gone into the

merits of the disputes raised on the application for

injunction and the Trial Court, while deciding the suit,

shall not be influenced by any of the observations made

by the Courts below as well as of this Court while

disposing of the application for injunction and the Trial




                                                       2
Court shall decide the same on merits in accordance

with law.

5.   With these observations and directions, these

appeals are disposed of. There will be no order as to

costs.
