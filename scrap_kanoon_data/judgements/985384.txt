                         CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                          CIVIL APPEAL NO.5656 OF 2008
                      (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.15866 of 2007)


State of Punjab &amp; Ors.                                         ...Appellant(s)

                                         Versus

Santosh Kumar                                                  ...Respondent(s)



                                      O R D E R

           Leave granted.
           Heard learned counsel for the parties.
           The High Court of Punjab and Haryana, having recorded a finding that it
had no territorial jurisdiction, was not justified in making any observation in relation
to the merit of the matter. Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside and the writ
petition filed by the respondent before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana is
dismissed on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction.
           We may, however, observe that this order shall not preclude the
respondent from moving the appropriate High Court for redressal of his grievances.
           The civil appeal is, accordingly, disposed of.

                                                                            ......................J.
                                                  [B.N. AGRAWAL]
