Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.

1.	Leave granted in SLP (C) Nos. 12791-12794 of 2006

2.	Challenge in these appeals is to the judgment of a 
Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court dismissing the 
Revision Petition filed under Section 23(1) of the Karnataka 
Sales Tax Act,  1957 (in short the Act).

3.	The controversy relates to assessment year 2002-2003. 
The appellant had filed the Revision Petitions questioning 
correctness of the order passed by the Karnataka Appellate 
Tribunal (in short the Tribunal) in STA Nos798-801 of 2003. 
The appeals were filed before the Tribunal under Section 22(1) 
of the Act against the order passed by the Joint Commissioner 
of Commercial Taxes (Appeals), Bangalore Division, Bangalore 
(hereinafter referred to as the Appellate Authority).  The said 
authority confirmed the provisional assessment orders of the 
Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Bangalore 
(hereinafter referred to as the Assessing Authority) for the 
months of May, June, July and September, 2002.  

4.	Factual position is almost undisputed and is as follows:

	The appellant is a limited company and has its registered 
office at Gujarat and branch office at Bangalore, Karnataka. It 
is a sub-contractor for M/s Larsen and Toubro Ltd. for 
execution of works contract.  It is registered as a dealer under 
the Act as well as Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (in short the 
Central Act). It had opted for composition under Section 17(6) 
of the Act. But the benefit of composition was denied in view of 
the amendment to sub-section (7) of Section 17. The appellant 
undisputedly had received goods from the head office situated 
at Gujarat for execution of the work in Karnataka. 

5.	Stand of the appellant before the departmental 
authorities and the Tribunal was that the receipt of goods from 
the head office does not amount to receiving of goods. The 
Tribunal referred to sub-section (7) of Section 17 as amended 
by Act No.5 of 2002 w.e.f. 1.4.2002 and held that in fact the 
provision clearly applied to the case of the appellant. 

6.	The following questions were raised before the High Court 
in the Revision Petition:

I.	Whether the Karnataka Appellate 
Tribunal was right in concluding that the 
amendment to Section 17(7) of the KST Act 
effective from 1.4.2002 would apply to 
agreements entered into prior to 1.4.2002.

II.	Whether the Karnataka Appellate 
Tribunal was right in holding that even 
transfers to stock would be hit by the 
amendment to Section 17(7) of the Karnataka 
Sales Tax Act effective 1.4.2002?


7.	Section 17(7) of the Act which has been introduced by 
the Karnataka Amendment Act 5 of 2002, with effect from 
1.4.2002 reads as under:

 "Nothing contained in sub-section (6) 
shall apply to a dealer who purchases or 
receives goods from outside the State for 
the purpose of using such goods in the 
execution of works contract"

8.	The legislature by introducing the above amendment to 
sub-Section (7) of Section 17 of the Act has restricted the 
benefit of composition amount for a dealer liable to tax under 
Section 5-B of the Act. By this amended provision, the 
Legislature mandates that a dealer who purchases or receives 
goods from outside the State for the purpose of using such 
goods in the execution of works contract is not eligible for 
benefit of composition amount for the works contract executed 
by him in that year in the State in respect of works specified in 
the Sixth Schedule to the Act.
 9.	Rule 8-B of the Karnataka Sales Tax Rules, 1957 (for 
short the `Rules') provides the procedure for composition of tax 
in the case of dealers executing works contract. Sub-rule (1) of 
Rule 8-B of the Rules envisages that the assessee/dealer shall 
submit an application in Form 8-AA to the assessing authority 
each year seeking composition benefit within One hundred 
and twenty days from the date of commencement of the 
assessment year or of the business, if he has commenced the 
business during the course of the year.
 10.	Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 8-B of the Rules mandates that the 
Assessing Authority after receipt of such application from the 
dealer/assessee, and after verifying the same, may permit the 
dealer, subject to the conditions specified in Sub-rule (1), to 
pay in lieu of the amount of tax payable by him during the 
year an amount by way of composition as provided in sub-
section (6) of Section 17 of the Act.
 11.	Clause (ii) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 8-B of the Rules 
envisages that the Assessing Authority shall give permission 
for composition within thirty days from the date of receipt of 
the application by the dealer/assesses under Sub-rule (1) of 
Rule 8-B of the Rules.

12.	The High Court dismissed the Revision Petition holding 
that sub-section (7) of Section 17 has clear application. The 
stand taken before the Tribunal and the High Court was re-
iterated in these appeals. 

13.	Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other 
hand supported the impugned judgment.

14.	It is to be noted that if the dealer wanted the benefit of 
sub-section (6) of Section 17, it was required to submit an 
application within one hundred twenty days from the date of 
commencement of the assessment year. The amended 
provision of sub-section (7) of Section 17 came into effect from 
1.4.2002.  The amended provision clearly excludes the dealer 
from the benefit of sub-section (6) of Section 17 of the Act if he 
purchases or receives goods from outside the State for the 
purposes of using such goods in the execution of the works 
contract.  If for any reason, the assessee had intended to opt 
for composition of tax under Section 17 (6) of the Act, 
necessarily he had to submit the application within one 
hundred and twenty days from the date of commencement of 
such year before the assessing authority to accept in lieu of 
tax payable under Section 5-B of the Act on the total value of 
the works contract being executed by him. The key words 
under Section 17 (6) of the Act are the tax payable during the 
year by way of composition an amount on the total 
consideration for the works executed by the contractor in that 
year in the year in the State. Option to be exercised for 
composition benefit is not dependent on the dates of the 
agreements entered into by the parties for execution of the 
works contract Under Rule 8B(1) of the Rules, the 
dealer/assessee is required to submit the application seeking 
composition benefit for each assessment year within the time 
prescribed from the date of commencement of such year or of 
the business, if he has commenced  the business during the 
course of the year. That again means, it is irrelevant, when the 
parties had entered into an agreement for the execution of 
works contract in the State. As already noticed, the relevant 
assessment year in question is 2002-2003 (ending on 
31.3.2003) and the assessee if it elected to compound the tax 
for this year, it was required to submit the application as 
provided under rule 8-B (1) of the rules.  The amended 
provisions of sub-section (7) of Section 17 were given effect to 
from 1.4.2002. In view of the restriction imposed under the 
amended provision, the assessing authority could not have 
permitted the appellant company to elect to pay the tax under 
Section 17(6) of the Act, since admittedly the appellant 
received the goods by way of stock transfers from outside the 
State for the purpose of using such goods in the execution of 
works contract. Therefore, the first question of law raised by 
the appellant has been rightly answered against the assessee. 
15.	The language used in sub-section (7) of Section 17 is very 
clear. It is to the effect that if a dealer purchases or receives 
goods from outside the State for execution of works contract 
within the State it is not entitled to the benefit of composition 
in terms of sub-section (6) of Section17 and undisputedly, the 
appellant has received the goods by way of stock transfer. In 
view of the language employed in the amended provision, the 
appellant was clearly disentitled from composition for availing 
the benefit under sub-section (6) of Section 17. The expression 
receives would encompass receipt in any manner.  Receipt by 
branch transfer is covered by the said expression. The High 
Court was, therefore, justified in dismissing the Revision 
Petition. We find no scope for taking a different view in view of 
the clear language of sub-section (7) of Section 17 as amended 
w.e.f. 1.4.2002.

16.	The appeals fail and are dismissed with no order as to 
costs.
