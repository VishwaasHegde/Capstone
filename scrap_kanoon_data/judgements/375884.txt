                                     IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                        CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION


                          CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 725 OF 2008
                          [Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No. 4569/2006]


UNION OF INDIA                                                   ...    APPELLANT(S)

                                         :VERSUS:

SUMER DAN AND ANR.                                               ...   RESPONDENT(S)




                                         ORDER

             Leave granted.

             This appeal is directed against a judgment and order dated 28.4.2006 of the

    High Court whereby and whereunder the order of conviction passed as against the

    respondent No.1 was directed to remain suspended till 31.7.2006.

             It appears that after the order of conviction dated 21.12.2005 and the

    impugned order of the High Court dated 28.4.2006 was passed, the first respondent

    had applied for voluntary retirement from 5.5.2006. However, having regard to the

    order of conviction, the respondent No.1 has been dismissed from service on 9.5.2006.




                                        -2-
         Having heard Mr. A. Sharan, learned Additional Solicitor General and Mr.

Francis, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.1, we are of the

opinion that in the facts and circumstances of this case, it is not necessary for us to go

into the correctness or otherwise of the impugned order as the main purpose for

which the special leave petition was filed was for obtaining a protection from the

order of dismissal from service passed as against respondent No.1. As the said order

of dismissal has to be challenged in an appropriate proceedings by the first

respondent on its own merit, we are not inclined to make any observation in relation

thereto. Furthermore, as the impugned order was passed on 28.4.2006, we are of the

opinion that interest of justice would be subserved if, keeping in view the passage of

time, the High Court is requested to dispose of the criminal appeal itself             as

expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of three months from the date of

receipt of a copy of this order and we do so.


         The appeal is disposed of with the aforementioned observation.
