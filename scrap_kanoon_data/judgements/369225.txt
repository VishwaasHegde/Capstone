O R D E R
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 349 OF  2008
(Arising out of SLP (Criminal) No.2458 of 2005)

	Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for both sides.
2.	By the impugned order dated 10.12.2004, the High Court has quashed 
the entire criminal proceedings initiated by the Appellant against the 
respondents 1 to 3 for offences under sections 379, 406, 411, 504 and 506 
IPC. For this purpose, the High Court has relied on the documents brought 
on record by the respondents 1 to 3 and assumed them to be genuine. The 
High Court has also opined that the dispute between the parties is of a civil 
nature and the criminal complaint was filed on account of mala fides of the 
Appellant. 

3.	The Appellant submitted that the police on investigation found that 
the accused had committed the offences and had filed a charge-sheet against 
them.

4.	We have perused the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge 
and find that no reason has been for arriving at a conclusion that the claim of 
the Appellant was of civil nature and complaint was motivated by mala 
fides. 

5.	We, therefore, set aside the judgment passed by the learned Single 
Judge and request the High Court to reconsider the Criminal Miscellaneous 
Case No.422 of 2003 and pass fresh order in accordance with law. The 
appeal is disposed of accordingly.
