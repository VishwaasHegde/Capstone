O R D E R  
[ARISING OUT OF S.L.P.(C) NOS. 17145-17146 OF 2005]

1.	Leave granted.
2.	Respondent Nos. 1 to 4 and 7 were selected as Senior Milk Inspectors in Dairy 
Development Hill Sub-Cadre  by the U.P. Public Service Commission under the U.P. Hill 
Sub-Cadre Rules, 1992.  After the bifurcation of the State of U.P., U.P.  Hill Sub-Cadre 
Rules, 1992 no longer remain in existence and, thus, the impugned order of the High 
Court in Civil  Misc. Writ Petition No. 47075 pf 2002 and Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 
29612 of 2003 directing the Government of U.P. to consider the appointment of 
respondents has been challenged in these appeals, by special leave, before this court.
3.	We have heard learned counsel for the parties and considered the material on 
record.  
4.	     Considering   the   facts    of   the case, we are of the opinion that the present case is 
squarely covered by the




decision of this Court in State of U.P. and others Vs. Rajkumar Sharma and others 
(2006) 3 SCC 330 wherein para 7 reads as under:
The stand of the appellant State before the High Court  was that 
considering the peculiar circumstances the only relief granted by this 
court was relaxation in age for a period of 3 years whenever the 
selection is held.  The Uttar Pradesh Hill Sub-Cadre Rules, 1992 (in 
short the 1992 Rules) were enacted for certain hill areas of the State 
of Uttar Pradesh as it stood before the reorganisation and the Rules 
were applicable in all districts of the hills, namely, Almora, Chamoli, 
Dehradun, Nainital, Pauri Garhwal, Pithoragarh, Tehri Garhwal, 
Uttarkashi and Udham Singh Nagar.  All the said districts now stand 
included in the State of Uttaranchal.  Therefore, the vacancies which 
were advertised for the hills could not be filled up as the said cadre 
stood abolished.  Reliance has been placed by the High Court on office 
memorandums issued on 31.1.1994 and 15.12.1999 which did not have 
any application whatsoever.

5.	In view of the aforesaid decision, the impugned order of the High Court is set aside.  
The appeals stand allowed with no order as to costs.
