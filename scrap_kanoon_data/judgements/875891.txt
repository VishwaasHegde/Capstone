O R D E R
[Arising out of SLP(C) No. 16620/2005]

	Leave granted.
	Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that in the 
peculiar facts and circumstances of this case and despite limited notice as to the 
amount of costs having been issued, interest of justice would be subserved if the State 
of Haryana is asked to transfer the sum of  Rs.30,000/- to the Haryana State Legal 
Services Authority, if the same has been deposited with it. We direct accordingly.

	We appreciate the stand taken by the learned counsel for the State that in a case of 
this nature, instead of the State deriving the benefit of costs awarded, the costs, if 
deposited, should be expended for a better cause.
	The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
