CIVIL APPEAL NO.      1183            OF 2008
(Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.21331 of 2002)

KAPADIA, J.

	Delay condoned. 
2.	Leave granted.
3.	In this civil appeal filed by the Department two questions 
of law arise for determination which questions are as follow: 
(1)	Whether interest paid in respect of borrowings 
on capital assets not put to use in the 
concerned financial year can be permitted as 
allowable deduction under Section 36(1)(iii) of 
the Income-tax Act, 1961?
(2)	Whether respondent-assessee had an option in 
law to claim partial depreciation in respect of 
any block of assets.

4.	Our answer to the above-mentioned	question No.(1) is 
squarely covered by our decision in favour of the assessee and 
against the Department in the case of Dy. Commr. of Income 
Tax, Ahmedabad v. M/s. Core Health Care Ltd. in Civil 
Appeal Nos.3952-55 of 2002.  

5.	Regarding the question No.(2), quoted above, it may be 
noted that the High Court has relied upon the judgment of this 
Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Mahendra Mills &amp; 
Anr.  (2000) 243 ITR 56 in which it has been held that the 
assessee has an option to claim depreciation.  However, 
Section 34(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short, "1961 
Act") has been omitted w.e.f. 1.4.88.  Therefore, we are 
remanding the matter to the High Court after setting aside the 
impugned order of the High Court on this question, with the 
direction to the High Court to consider : whether the assessee 
has an option in law to claim partial depreciation in respect of 
block of assets.  In the case of Mahendra Mills (supra) the 
concept of block of assets was not there.  In our view, 
substantial question of law did arise for determination before 
the High Court under Section 260A of the 1961 Act, 
particularly when Section 34(1) of the 1961 Act stood omitted 
w.e.f. 1.4.88.  The High Court is also requested to consider 
whether the judgment of this Court in the case of Mahendra 
Mills (supra) would apply to the assessment years under 
consideration.  In this connection the High Court is also 
requested to take into account the scope of Explanation 5 to 
Section 32(1) of the 1961 Act, made by the Finance Act, 2001.

6.	Accordingly question No.(1) is answered in favour of 
assessee and against the Department and question No.(2) is 
remitted to the High Court.  Consequently the Department's 
civil appeal is partly allowed with no order as to cost.
