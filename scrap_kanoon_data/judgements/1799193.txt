CIVIL APPEAL NO.6069 OF 2001 

	In our view, this appeal is bound to succeed on a very short question.
	The High Court by the impugned judgment and order dt.09.08.2000 rejected the 
contention of the appellant on the ground that the said contention was not raised before the 
courts below.  In our view, the question raised by the appellant was a pure question of law which 
ought to have been permitted by the High Court to be raised while deciding the appeal. That 
being the position, we set aside the impugned order and remit the case back to the High Court for 
disposal in accordance with law after permitting the parties to raise the question that was raised 
in the appeal and thereafter decide the appeal.  The appeal is allowed to the extend indicated 
above.  There shall be no order as to costs.
