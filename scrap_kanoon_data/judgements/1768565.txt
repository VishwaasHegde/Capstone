JUDGMENT
	  O R D E R
	CIVIL APPEAL NO. 913  OF 2008
[Arising out of SLP(C)No.17187 of 2004]

	Leave granted.
	In this appeal, Section 4 Notification was issued on 14/08/2000 for acquiring the 
land for public purpose, namely to supply drinking water in  Canal Based Water Supply Scheme.  
Challenge of the acquisition before the High Court was dismissed by the High Court.   This Court at 
SLP stage issued notice on 03/09/2004 on a contention of the appellants that the Gram Panchayat land 
itself is available to satisfy their requirement and yet the appellants' land, who are agriculturists have 
been acquired by depriving their livelihood.  A counter affidavit has been filed by the State stating that 
the land of the appellants is suitable for the public purpose and for which  it is acquired after their 
subjective satisfaction of the acquiring authority, and since land has been acquired after the  subjective   
satisfaction   of the authority,  this  Court should not 


					-2-
interfere.   We are of the view that  which land is suitable to be acquired is the authority to decide after 
subjective satisfaction and not for this Court to decide such issue.   There is no merit in this appeal.   It 
is accordingly dismissed.
	It is open to the appellants to move an appropriate application before the State 
authority and if it is found that  the project has been completed and the purpose of acquisition has been 
achieved in the meantime, as contended by the counsel for the appellants, an appropriate order may be 
passed.
           	There shall be no orders as to costs.
