CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3763 OF 2002


	After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we propose to dispose of this 
appeal by a short order.

	The grounds on which this appeal would succeed is that in the appeal 
memo a specific ground is taken that after the acceptance of the final 
measurement while accepting the Ninth Running Account Bill being the Final 
Bill, no arbitrable dispute would remain between the appellant and the 
respondent.  

	We have gone through the judgment rendered by the Division Bench.  The 
aforesaid ground raised in the memorandum of appeal and the other grounds 
have not been dealt with by the Division Bench of the High Court. On this sole 
ground, this appeal succeeds.  

.......2.

- 2 -

	This appeal is allowed.  The impugned order of the High Court is set aside.  
The matter is remanded to the High Court to dispose of afresh after dealing 
with all the grounds mentioned in the memorandum of appeal.

	The appellant may approach the High Court for an interim order.
