                               CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION


                               CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4767 OF 2008
                               [Arising out of SLP(C) No.21105/2006]
PRATIBHA                                                           ...   APPELLANT(S)
                                            :VERSUS:

THE OFFICIAL LIQUIDATOR OF M/S. VIDARBHA                           ...   RESPONDENT(S)
PHARMACEUTICALS PVT. LTD.


                                            ORDER

                Leave granted.

                This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 11.10.2006

    passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Company Appeal No.1 of 2003,

    summarily rejecting an appeal filed under Section 483 of the Companies Act, 1956,

    stating :

                "In view of the affirmation of the impugned order by the Hon'ble
                Apex Court in C.A.No. 1156/2006 in the case of Avinash Hansraj
                Gajbhiye vs. Official Liquidator, we do not find any reason to
                entertain this appeal. The appeal is dismissed in limine with no
                order as to costs."
                Civil Appeal No. 1106/2006, referred to in the impugned order of the High

    Court, was filed by one Shri Avinash Hansraj Gajbhiye. Only because the appeal

    preferred by another Director of M/s. Vidarbha Pharmaceuticals Pvt.

                                           -2-
Ltd. had been dismissed, in our opinion, the Division Bench of the High Court

committed a serious error in dismissing the appeal of the appellant; particularly when

according to the appellant, although she was appointed a Director of the said

company on 8.8.1978, she resigned from the said post in the year 1986 itself; whereas

the default on the part of the Company took place in the year 1990.

         It furthermore appears that the appellant had filed her reply in the

proceedings in the year 1995 and as her Advocate had expired in 1996 she did not

receive any notice from the High Court and an ex-parte order passed in the year 1999.

An application for recalling of the said ex-parte order was rejected by the High Court

without considering these facts.

         For the reasons aforementioned, we set aside the impugned judgment and

remand the matter back to the Division Bench of the High Court for consideration of

the matter afresh on merit.

         The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
