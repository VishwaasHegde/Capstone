CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.  645   OF  2006


	This is an application filed on behalf of Padma Charan Patra for 
relaxation of the conditions of bail enforced by our order dated 12.5.2006 
while granting bail to the petitioner.  The said conditions are as follows:

1	That the appellant shall report to the named Police Station once 
every fortnight.
2	The appellant shall not leave the State of Orissa without 
informing the Investigating Officer.
3	The appellant shall not tamper with the evidence or threaten any 
witness or try to influence any person concerned with the 
investigation of the case.

	It has been brought to our notice that some of the co-accused 
approached the High Court and obtained bail on the same terms and 
conditions as was granted by this Court and subsequently they have  also 
obtained relaxation of the first two conditions from the High Court.

-2-
	It has also been brought to our notice by the learned counsel 
appearing for the State that similar applications appeared to have been 
filed by other co-accused in this Court which were however dismissed.

	Be that as it may, since it appears from the order of the High Court 
that investigation has been completed, we relax the first two conditions 
indicated hereinabove and also direct that  the petitioner shall not leave 
India without permission of this Court and shall report to the Investigating 
Agency as and when required.

	Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 6016/2007 is accordingly 
disposed of.
