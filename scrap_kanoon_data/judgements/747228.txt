Bench: H.K. Sema, Markandey Katju
                                   IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                         CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                             CIVIL APPEAL NO. 7974 OF 2002

STATE OF PUNJAB &amp; ORS.                                                        .......APPELLANT(S)

                                                          Versus

BALWINDER KAUR &amp; ORS.                                                         .....RESPONDENT(S)


                                        ORDER

          The order appealed against was passed by the High Court in Regular Second
Appeal.   The High Court disposed of the Regular Second Appeal in terms of the
following order:
                        "At the request of counsel for the appellant and
             respondent in person, instead of stay application, appeal itself is
             taken on board for final disposal.

                        No merit. Dismissed."
          The order is cryptic, lacks reasons. We, accordingly, set aside the impugned
order and remand the matter to the High Court to dispose of the appeal in accordance
with law. The appeal is restored to the file of the High Court. Since the appeal is
pending for quite sometime, the High Court is requested to dispose of the appeal as
expeditiously as possible.

          Appeal is allowed.
