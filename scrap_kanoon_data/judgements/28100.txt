		Application of Section 3 of the Kerala Service Inam Lands ( Vesting 
and Infringement) Act, 1981 (for short hereinafter referred to as 'the said Act') vis-a-
vis the possession of the parties is the question involved in these appeals which arise 
out of judgments and orders dated 24.2.2006  passed by a Division Bench of the 
Kerala High Court.
	The parties hereto claim settlement from the original   Inam  holder Kali 
Pillai Gopala Pillai. Appellant(s) claim that the said Inam holder settled 43 cents out 
of 49 cents in Survey No.1983 of Madathuvilakom village in their favour. One Nani 
Devki predecessor in interest of the respondents(now represented by Lrs.being 
respondent Nos. 1-5) claimed that they were also the lessees of the said Inam holder. 
-1-
	The son of the original Inam holder Gopalan Pillai Velappan 
Nair(respondent No.9 herein) filed a suit for recovery of possession of the said 
property with arrears of rent against the appellant which was decreed.
	However, it appears that the execution petition to enforce the said decree 
was pending. Respondents herein claim that they had all along been in possession of 
the said property. In fact they obstructed execution of the said decree on 14.8.1971. 
According to the respondents the said suit was a collusive one. 
	The said Act came into force with effect from 6.8.1981. Appointed date has 
been defined in the Act; meaning the date from which the said  Act came into force.
	Indisputably, in terms of Section 3 of the Act, the Inam land vests in the 
Government. The Act provides for grant of settlement in favour of a person who may 
file an application therefor being in possession of the property.
	For obtaining settlement not only  the appellant but also the said Nani Devki 
as also aforementioned Gopalan Pillai Velappan Nair filed their respective 
applications.
	An inquiry was made by the Settlement Officer. It was held that up of 
March, 1981 the aforementioned Nani Devki was in possession but she was forcibly 
dispossessed by the appellant herein. However, the matter was remanded by the 
District Collector by an order dated 23.10.1987. Pursuant to or in furtherance of the 
said order dated 23.10.1987 a fresh inquiry was held and in its report the Settlement 
Officer 
-2-

recorded that the property in question was in possession of the appellant herein as on 
the appointed date. The land in 
question was directed to be settled in favour of the appellant.
	Aggrieved by and dis-satisfied therewith Nani Devki preferred an appeal 
which was dismissed. The revision application filed before the State was also 
dismissed by an order dated 26.2.1990. Nani Devki filed a writ petition before the 
High Court. By reason of a deed  of assignment executed on 6.11.1992, the property 
was transferred. On 16.3.1999, a learned Single Judge of the Kerala High Court 
allowed the writ petition. An intra Court appeal filed thereagainst has been  dismissed 
by reason of the impugned judgment.
	Indisputably, the learned Single Judge and consequently the Division Bench 
of the High Court arrived at a decision that the Settlement Officer, the Appellate 
Authority as also the Revisional Authority committed a serious error in ignoring the 
first report as also the documents filed by the respondents herein,namely, Exhibits 
A-1, A-2 and A3. 
	On the said findings it was directed as under:
	"9. From what is stated above, it could be seen that dismissal of the 
application filed by the first petitioner and ordering assignment of the holding in 
favour of the 4th respondent is not in accordance with law and cannot be justified.

		-3-
	In the result the original petition is allowed. Exhibits P3,P4,and P5 are 
quashed. O.A.Nos. 76 of 1982,640 of 1982 and 861 of 1982 are restored to file and 
remanded to the 
third respondent for fresh disposal in accordance with law and in the light of the 
observations made in this judgment."
	The Division Bench of the High Court while affirming  
the said view, held:
	" 6. Of course the appellant-4th respondent heavily would rely on the findings 
regarding his possession in OS No.953/1966 and A.S.No.717 of 1972 arising 
therefrom. But that is a suit between the 4th respondent and 5th respondent in the O.P. 
which cannot bind the petitioners in the OP since the 1st petitioner was not a party to 
the suit.

7.	Once the lower authorities have categorically found, as a matter of fact, 
that the 1st petitioner was in possession till about March, 1981 and she was 
forcibly dispossessed by the fourth respondent. We are unable to find any 
infirmity in the findings of the learned Single Judge. In that view, we are 
of the opinion that there is no illegality whatsoever in the judgment of the 
learned Single Judge and these appeals deserve to be dismissed. We do so. 
But taking into account the facts and circumstances of the case we do not 
make any order as to costs.."
	It was observed that in view of the fact that the appellant herein did not 
question the purported findings of the Settlement Officer dated 26.2.1985, wherein the 
Settlement Officer and respondent Nos. 2 and 3 therein had found the first 
respondent to be in actual possession till about March 1981 and she was forcibly 
evicted by the fourth respondent from the land, the order of the revenue authority 
which was impugned therein could not be sustained.
	Mr.L.N. Rao, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant 
would submit that having regard to 
-4-




the fact that the inquiry in the first round of litigation came to an end and fresh 
inquiry was initiated in terms of the order of the District Collector dated 23.10.1987, 
the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. We find considerable force therein.
	The Settlement Officer for the purpose of grant of settlement of service Inam 
lands was bound to arrive at a finding of fact as to who amongst the applicants was in 
possession of the land in question as on 6.8.1981. 
	For the said purpose it was obligatory on the part of the said authority to 
consider both the oral and documentary evidences produced by the parties.
	Keeping in view the nature of the order passed by the District Collector on 
23.10.1987,in our opinion, the exercise pursuant to order passed by the learned Single 
Judge as also the Division Bench should be carried out un-influenced by any 
observation made by the High Court. It goes without saying that the Settlement 
Officer shall determine the question in regard to the possession of the land by the 
respective claimants as on 6.8.1981 strictly on the basis of the materials which are 
placed by the parties and in accordance with law.
	The impugned judgment is set aside. The appeals are allowed with the 
aforementioned observations.

	Parties to maintain Status-Quo till the matter is decided by the Settlement 
Officer.
