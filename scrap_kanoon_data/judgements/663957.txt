            Heard learned counsel for the parties.
            In spite of service of notice, nobody has entered appearance to contest the

            It appears that in First Appeal No.43 of 2002 on 24th July, 2006, a mutual
consent divorce decree was passed whereunder the husband was directed to pay a
sum of Rupees five lakhs to the wife by way of permanent alimony in three equal
quarterly instalments of Rs.1,66,666.50. The appellant is said to have made payment
of first instalment and filed a petition for extension of time for making payment of
other two instalments, which prayer has been rejected by the impugned order.
Hence, this appeal by special leave.
            During the pendency of this appeal, by virtue of order of this Court, the
appellant has further deposited a sum of Rupees one lakh sixty thousand before the
Registrar
                                                                                  ....2/-
                                          -2-
of the High Court. It has been stated that in all the appellant has made payment of
Rupees three lakhs eighty nine thousand out of Rupees five lakhs. The counsel for the
appellant, who is having a bank draft for the balance amount of Rupees one lakh
elevan thousand is permitted to deposit the same with the Registrar of the High Court
within a period of two weeks from today. The respondent shall be permitted to
withdraw the amounts deposited by the appellant before the Registrar of the High
Court.
           In view of these facts, time granted by the High Court by consent decree
dated 24th July, 2006, is, accordingly, extended.
           The civil appeal is, accordingly, disposed of.
