CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 288  OF 2008
[Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No.1813/2007]

	Leave granted.
	Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and keeping in view the decision of 
this Court in Dilip S. Dahanukar vs. Kotak Mahindra Co. Ltd. and Anr., [2007 (6) 
SCC 528], and furthermore in view of the statement made at the Bar that all the 
properties of the Company as also its directors have been attached, we are of the 
opinion that in the interest of justice, the appellants may not be asked to deposit any 
amount of compensation. However, we would request the Sessions Court to consider 
the desirability of disposing of the criminal appeal as expeditiously as possible.

	The appeal is disposed of with the aforementioned observation and direction.
