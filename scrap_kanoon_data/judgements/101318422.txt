                  CONTEMPT PETITION(C) NO.266 OF 2005

                      WRIT PETITION (C) NO.580/1995


RAM NARESH PRASAD SINGH                      Petitioner(s)

               VERSUS

G.S.KUNG &amp; ORS.                               Respondent(s)

WITH CONMT.PET.(C)NO.380/2004 IN W.P.(C)NO.580/1995


                                 ORDER

1.        Heard both sides.


2.        The petitioner in both the petitions-Ram Naresh Prasad Singh was

initially appointed as a Science Teacher in a Sanskrit School. The school was

being maintained by the Sanskrit Siksha Board but, later in the year 1980,

the school was taken over by the Government under the provisions of

Ordinance dated 18.12.1989.     The petitioner was allegedly continued as a

teacher in the school but the salary was being paid by the government.

Though the respondents contend that in the year 1989 his          service was

terminated, but some of the records produced before us show that he

continued as a teacher till 2002 and thereafter as an Assistant Head Master

upto 2004. Learned counsel appearing for the Government contends that he

was not working as an Assistant Head Master and was not attending the

school and the records show that he continued      as an     Assistant   Head
                           2

Master as there was   no
                                      3

effective order of termination was passed in his favour. Though several

pending proceedings were against him, the appropriate authority had not

passed any order and this led to a situation where the petitioner had to

continue in the school as an Assistant Head Master.

3.        The petitioner alleges that he was not paid any salary from

1.4.2002 till December, 2003. Having regard to the peculiar circumstances

of the case, we direct respondent nos.1,2 and 3 to pay a sum of Rs.1 lac to

the petitioner within a period of three months as final settlement.

4.        The contempt petitions are disposed of accordingly. No costs.

                                                                .................J.
                                                         (P.SATHASIVAM)
