CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3946 OF 2002

	In this appeal, plaintiff suit for declaration of title and delivery of possession was 
dismissed by the trial Court and upheld by the first appellate Court.  In second appeal, 
the High Court reversed the finding of facts recorded by the trial Court and affirmed 
by the first appellate Court.  The High Court has framed the following purported 
substantial questions of law:
	"(a)	Whether the courts below in rejecting the 
case of sale as propounded by the plaintiff merely on the 
ground that according to the appellant the land was already 
sold on 24.11.1971, were right?

	(b)	Whether the courts below were right in 
refusing the registered sale deed dated 15.07.1983 as an 
additional evidence by order dated 24.04.1987 and the prayer 
had been allowed on 02.07.1985?"

	In our view, the two questions, which are framed by the High Court as substantial 
questions of law, does not appear to

be so.  In fact, they are questions of fact.  Both the questions of fact framed by the High 
Court have been elaborately dealt with by the trial Court and affirmed by the first 
appellate Court.  So far, with regard to the alleged registered sale deed dated 
24.11.1971 is concerned, both the trial Court and the first appellate court have dealt 
with elaborately after examining the evidence on record and documents and have come 
to the conclusion that the plaintiff has failed to establish the registered sale deed dated 
24.11.1971 as genuine documents.

	Since we are of the view that the aforesaid two questions framed by the High Court 
are not substantial questions of law but questions of fact which have been elaborately 
dealt with by the trial Court and by the first appellate Court, the High Court, in second 
appeal, was not justified in interfering with the findings of  fact  recorded by the two 
courts.

	For the reasons afore-stated, the order of the High Court is set aside.  This appeal is 
allowed.  No costs.
