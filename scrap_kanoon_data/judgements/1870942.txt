O R D E R	
CIVIL APPEAL NO.  6677   OF 2002


	Heard the parties.
	The order impugned passed by the High Court arises out of the order 
passed by the Trial Court under the provision of Order XXXIX and Rule 1 
and 2.
	The whole dispute relates to the agreement entered into between the 
appellant (tenant) and the respondent (landlord) on 8.6.2001.  In the said 
agreement it is specifically provided as under:

	"Whereas the aforesaid owners/landlords have offered to 
let out a portion of first floor area (approximate) 17'x35' 
with minimum height 12' for the purpose of carrying 
business by aforesaid tenant Virendra Kumar Sahu and 
the aforesaid tenant has agreed to take on rent portion on 
the first floor (approximate) 17'x35' with minimum height 
12' for carrying business in the said portion on the terms 
and condition hereinafter mentioned."

-2-
	Since there is an agreement entered into between the landlord and tenant 
we are of the view that the terms of agreement should be strictly adhered 
to by both the parties.  We accordingly dispose of this appeal with the 
direction that the parties should strictly adhere to the conditions 
contained in the agreement dated 8.6.2001.  We, therefore, direct the Trial 
Court to appoint  a local Advocate (Commissioner) to go to the disputed 
building and deliver possession to the tenant in terms of the aforesaid 
agreement. The remuneration of the Commissioner shall be fixed by the 
Trial Court.  
	The order impugned passed by the High Court is accordingly set aside.  
In view  of our aforesaid direction the suit shall stand closed.
	The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
