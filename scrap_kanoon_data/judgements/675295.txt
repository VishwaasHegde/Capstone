                     IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
          CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

         CIVIL APPEAL NO......................OF 2008
      (Arising out of SLP)No.7510 of 2007)


Haryana Waqf Board                     .....Appellant

VERSUS

Shanti Sarup &amp; Ors.                    ...Respondents.


                  O R D E R

1.     Leave granted.


2.     This is an appeal filed by the Punjab

Waqf Board who was the plaintiff in a suit

for declaration and injunction. The High

Court in the second appeal had summarily

dismissed the appeal on the ground that

the    second    appeal     was    concluded    by      the

concurrent findings of fact arrived at by

the     courts     below.      From    the     judgment

itself, it would appear that the Board had

failed to prove that the respondents have

encroached       any    land      belonging    to       the

appellant-Board. In view of the aforesaid

                                                          1
position, the second appeal was summarily

dismissed by the High Court. In our view,

the High Court ought not to have dismissed

the suit summarily merely on the ground

that the second appeal was concluded by

the    concurrent          findings          of     fact.      The

dispute      that    was       raised       by    the    parties

before       the         court        was        whether        the

respondent        had     encroached         upon       any   land

belonging           to         the          appellant-Board.

Therefore, it cannot be in dispute that

the    dispute           was     in     respect          of    the

encroachment of the suit land. Admittedly,

in    this   case,        an   application             was    filed

under Order 26 Rule 9 of the Code of Civil

Procedure which was rejected by the trial

court but in view of the fact that it was

a    case    of     demarcation         of       the    disputed

land, it was appropriate for the court to

direct the          investigation by appointing a

Local Commissioner under Order 26 Rule 9

of the CPC. The appellate court found that

                                                                  2
the    trial       court       did        not     take       into

consideration the pleadings of the parties

when there was no specific denial on the

part    of   the     respondents               regarding      the

allegations of unauthorized possession in

respect of the suit land by them as per

paragraph 3 of the plaint. But the only

controversy         between          the        parties       was

regarding      demarcation           of    the     suit      land

because      land        of   the         respondents         was

adjacent      to     the       suit        land     and       the

application        for    demarcation           filed    before

the trial court was wrongly rejected. It

is also not in dispute that even before

the    appellate     court,      the       appellant-Board

had filed an application for appointment

of a Local Commissioner for demarcation of

the suit land. In our view, this aspect of

the matter was not at all gone into by the

High    Court      while      dismissing          the    second

appeal summarily. The High Court ought to

have    considered        whether         in    view    of    the

                                                                3
nature of dispute and in the facts of the

present       case,     whether               the                 Local

Commissioner should be appointed for the

purpose of demarcation in respect of the

suit land.


3.     For the reasons aforesaid, we are of

the view that the High Court ought to have

considered this aspect of the matter and

then    to    decide   the   second                appeal                 on

merits.      Accordingly,    we      set           aside               the

judgment and decree passed in the second

appeal and the second appeal is restored

to its original file.         The High Court is

requested to decide the second appeal in

the light of the observations made herein

above within six months from the date of

supply of a copy of this order to it. The

appeal is thus allowed. There will be no

order as to costs.
