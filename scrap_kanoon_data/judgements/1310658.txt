STATE BANK OF INDIA                               .....APPELLANT(S)


                                             VERSUS


MELA RAM &amp; ORS.                                ....RESPONDENT(S)


                               O R D E R

         Heard learned counsel for the parties.

         In our view, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, we are not inclined to exercise

our power under Article 136 of the Constitution of India because we find from the record that the

decree passed in favour of the appellant has already been satisfied and the execution case has

already been disposed of. Accordingly this appeal is dismissed.           There will be no order as to

costs.
