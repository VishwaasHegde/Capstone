Dr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.	

	Heard learned counsel for the parties.

	Delay in filing counter affidavit is condoned. Amendment allowed.

	In the transfer petition, prayer is made for transfer of certain Writ Petitions 
before the Chhatisgarh High Court, Writ Appeals and Suits filed before the Lower 
Court in the State of Chattisgarh.  In S.L.P. (C) No.21632 of 2007, challenge is to the 
interim order dated 31.10.2007 passed in Writ Appeal No.267 of 2007.   

	Learned counsel for the petitioners in the Transfer Petition  and the Special 
Leave Petition submitted  that  though  the  subject  matter  of  controversy   in  all  
the aforesaid cases is broadly covered by a decision of this Court in T.N. Godavarman 
Thirumulpad Vs. Union of India and Ors. (2006 (5) SCC 28), the fresh rounds of 
litigation have been and/or are being started with the sole object of taking away the 
effect of the judgment in the said case.  This is stoutly denied by learned counsel 
appearing for the respondents.  
	Considering the nature of the controversy, we feel that interest of justice would 
be best served if the Transfer Petition (along with I.A. Nos.2 and 3 in the Transfer 
Petition) and the Special Leave Petition are disposed of on the following terms: 

1.	 All the Writ Petitions and Writ Appeals detailed in the Transfer 
Petition and the I.A. Nos.2 and 3 shall be heard and disposed of 
by the High Court by 15.05.2008.  

2.	  The parties are directed to appear before the Bench presided 
over by Hon'ble the Chief Justice of the High Court, without 
further notice, on 11.02.2008 so that a firm date can be fixed for 
starting hearing of the Writ Petitions and the Writ Appeals.  
Though the Writ Petitions are normally heard by a single
Judge in the High Court, in view of the fact that the Writ 
Appeals are to be heard by the Division Bench, all those Writ 
Petitions shall be tagged on and shall be heard by a Division 
Bench.  

3.	It is stated that certain Suits are pending before the Lower 
Courts.  The Bench presided over by Hon'ble the Chief Justice 
of the High Court shall transfer all such Suits to the High Court, 
to be taken up along with the Writ Petitions and the Writ 
Appeals.

4. 	  If  cases concerning the nature of the dispute pending 
before the High Court are instituted hereinafter, the High Court 
shall take up them along with the Writ Petitions, Writ Appeals 
and Suits which have been directed to be heard, and in case of 
Suits, by directing transfer to the High Court if they are filed in 
Lower Courts. 

5.  It is open to the petitioners in the Special Leave Petition to 
move, if so advised, the Bench hearing the Writ Petitions, Writ 
Appeals and Suits for modification/vacation of the impugned 
order dated 31.10.2007 passed in Writ Appeal No.267 of 2007.

	The Transfer Petition and the Special Leave Petition are 
disposed of accordingly.
	Contempt Petition No.14 of 2008 is withdrawn in view of the orders passed 
above.
	No orders on the application for impleadment.
