	Leave granted.
	The short question which arises for determination in these civil appeals is : whether 
the appellant-assessee was liable to pay additional tax on account of adjustment on its 
return for the assessment year 1996-97 and 1997-98 under Section 143(1)(a) read with 
Section 143(1A) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 vide order dated 17.12.1997.
	During the relevant assessment years, appellant claimed deduction under Section 
80-O of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short "1961 Act") in respect of qualifying income 
brought into India in convertible foreign exchange.  In its return, appellant indicated 
the qualifying income as gross figure.  By way of adjustment, under Section 143(1)(a) of 
the 1961 Act, the ITO restricted the qualifying income to the net figure.  In other 
words, assessee claimed gross income, earned in foreign exchange, as qualifying income 
whereas the ITO granted deduction by restricting the claim of the assessee to the net 
income.  
	On 17.12.1997 the question : as to whether the eligible income should be taken at the 
gross figure or net figure, was the question of interpretation.  There were several 
conflicting decisions on this point.  Therefore, according to appellant, Section 143(1)(a) 
was not applicable and consequently the appellant is not liable to pay additional tax 
under Section 143(1A).  At this stage, it may be noted that subsequently regular 
assessment was carried out by the ITO under Section 143(3).  We are not concerned in 
this case with regular assessment under Section 143(3).  
	The only point raised by the appellant is that it is not liable to pay additional tax as 
Section 143(1)(a), as it stood during the relevant year, was not applicable to the facts of 
this case because a moot point had arisen which could not have been a matter of 
adjustment under that section and which point needed consideration and 
determination only under regular assessment vide Section 143(3) of the 1961 Act.  
	We find merit in this civil appeal.  As stated above, we are concerned with the 
assessment years 1996-97 and 1997-98.  One of the main conditions stipulated by way of 
the first proviso to Section 143(1)(a), as it stood during the relevant time, referred to 
prima facie adjustments.  The first proviso permitted the Department to make 
adjustments in the income or loss declared in the return in cases of arithmetical errors 
or in cases where any loss carried forward or deduction or disallowance which on the 
basis of information available in such return was prima facie admissible but which was 
not claimed in the return or in cases where any loss carried forward, or deduction or 
allowance claimed in the return which on the basis of information available in such 
return was prima facie inadmissible.  In the present case, therefore, when there were 
conflicting judgments on interpretation of Section 80-O, in our view, prima facie 
adjustments contemplated under Section 143(1)(a) was not applicable and, therefore, 
consequently appellant was not liable to pay additional tax under Section 143(1A) of 
the 1961 Act.
	Before concluding, we may reiterate that in this case we are not concerned with the 
order of the assessment passed by the ITO later on under regular assessment under 
Section 143(3) of the 1961 Act.
	For the above reasons, the impugned judgment is set aside and the civil appeals, 
filed by the assessee, stand allowed with no order as to costs.
