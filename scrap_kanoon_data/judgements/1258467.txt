INTERLOCUTORY APPLICATION NO. 5 OF 2007
IN
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5503 OF 2003

O R D E R




1.	Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
2.	This application has been filed by the appellant  Bank 
for correction of factual submission  No. 1 recorded at internal 
page 4 of the judgment of this Court dated 12.01.2007.  
3.	In the judgment dated 12.01.2007, this Court recorded 
three submissions made by Shri Raju Ramachandran, Senior 
Advocate appearing on behalf of applicant  bank.  The first 
submission as recorded in the judgment was, pension 
regulations do not apply to the respondent No. 1 as he is an 
award staff.  This submission appears to have been 
mistakenly mentioned in the judgment dated 12.01.2007 and 
it needs to be suitably corrected to the extent that there was 
no scheme/provision of voluntary retirement in the terms and 
conditions of service applicable to the award staff to which 
respondent No. 1 belonged.
4.	The rectification of the above said submission is essential 
because this factual mistake has been recorded in the 
judgment as a submission of the learned senior counsel 
appearing on behalf of the appellant  bank due to oversight.  
The applicant  bank in this application has categorically 
submitted that the pension regulations are applicable to all 
employees of the bank irrespective of whether they are officers 
or award staff.
5.	Thus, in the factual situation as noticed above, the first 
submission recorded in the judgment dated 12.01.2007 shall 
stand rectified and corrected to the above extent which shall 
form part of the main judgment.  We may make it clear that 
this order of change/rectification of the factual mistake of first 
submission noticed in the judgment will have no bearing or 
effect on the final result of the appeal which was decided on 
other issues and contentions on merits.
6.	Interlocutory Application stands, accordingly, allowed.
