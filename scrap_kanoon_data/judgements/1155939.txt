JUDGMENT

O R D E R
	
	This appeal is directed against the order passed by the learned Single Judge of 
the High Court of Allahabad setting aside the interim order passed by the trial 
court under Order 39, Rule 1 of Code of Civil Procedure and confirmed by the 
First Appellate Court, but set aside by the High Court in writ jurisdiction.
	The Suit is of 1995 and the basic question that arises for consideration is 
whether the appellants were appointed by the Committee of Management, 
Balika Uchchatar Madhyamik Vidayalaya or not.  This is not the stage to go 
into the question whether they will be entitled to salary during this period or 
not as the first question has to be decided whether they were appointed by the 
Management in pursuance of the order or not.  Therefore, we do not think that 
these issues can be decided in these proceedings.
	However, we direct that the trial court should decide the suit within a period of 
six months from the date of the receipt of copy of this order.  This will resolve  
all controversies involved in this matter.  The Trial court may proceed with the 
matter and decide the same without being influenced by any observation made 
in any of the orders passed by the courts below. 
	The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
