WITH  CIVIL APPEAL NO......../2008 @ SLP (C) NO. 19879/2006)


	Heard learned counsel for the parties.
	Leave granted.
	Challenge in this appeal is to the interim order dated 19th September, 2006 
passed in Appeal No. 245/2006 which is stated to be pending before the Bombay 
High Court.  Considering the limited nature of the controversy, we request the 
High Court to dispose of the appeal within a period of three months from today.  
The parties agree that they shall bring to the notice of the High Court today's 
order.  The order of status quo passed by this Court on 08.12.2006 shall continue 
till the disposal of the  appeal by the High Court.  We  make  it  clear  that 




 by  giving  this protection, it shall not be construed as if we have expressed any 
opinion on the merits of the appeal which shall be heard by the High Court.  It is 
stated that cross objection has also been filed. The same shall be taken up for 
disposal on merits.  It is stated that plea of non maintainability is raised by some 
of the parties.  Needless to say that plea shall be duly considered.
	The appeals are accordingly disposed of.
