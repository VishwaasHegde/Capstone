  CIVIL APPEAL NO.3194 OF 2008 
(Arising out of SLP(C)No.3916 of 2007)


	Delay condoned.
	Leave granted.
	While issuing notice on 19.02.2007, we passed the following Order :- 
	"Issue notice, returnable within four weeks, on the question of 
condonation of delay and also on the special leave petition to the extent that 
whether the petitioner is liable to pay interest @ 18% or not.  
	There shall be interim stay of the operation of the impugned 
judgment."

	The only contention raised before us was whether the appellant was liable to pay interest at 
the rate of 18% or not as directed by the High Court.  Since we have issued limited notice on the 
Special Leave Petition, we are not inclined to decide whether the question of limitation taken by the 
learned counsel for the appellant was justified or not.  In that view of the matter and after hearing 
learned counsel for the parties, we direct to pay 9% interest instead of 18% interest as awarded by 
the arbitrator. With this modification, the appeal stands disposed of.  There shall be no order as to 
costs.
