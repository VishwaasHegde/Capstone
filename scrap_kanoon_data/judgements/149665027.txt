      After hearing learned ASG appearing on behalf of the appellants and learned counsel

appearing on behalf of the respondent and after considering the entire materials on record, we do

not find any ground to interfere with the impugned order excepting that the award that has been

passed by the arbitrator shall stand modified to the extent of granting interest @ 12% per annum

instead of 18% per annum. The appeal is accordingly disposed of without any order as to costs.
