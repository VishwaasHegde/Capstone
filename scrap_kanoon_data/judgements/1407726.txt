                              CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3088 OF 2008
                           [Arising out of SLP(C) No. 5583/2007]


MODI INDUSTRIES LTD.                                             ...   APPELLANT(S)

                                         :VERSUS:

STATE OF U.P. AND ORS.                                           ...   RESPONDENT(S)




                                         ORDER

             Leave granted.

             The matter stood adjourned from time to time awaiting the decision of the

     BIFR. The BIFR has since passed an order on 26.3.2008 the material portion whereof

     reads as under:

             "17. Having considered the facts on record, the Bench observed that
             in the hearing held on 12.3.2007, the Bench had directed the
             promoters of the company to submit fully tied up proposals jointly or
             severally, to IDBI (OA) within three months, in terms of Hon'ble
             AAIFR order dated 24.5.2006. IDBI (OA) was directed to submit a
             fully tied up DRS to the Board within two months thereafter. The
             cut-off date for the scheme was to be taken as 30.6.2007.
             Notwithstanding the interim orders of status quo of the Hon'ble
             AAIFR, the final cut-off-date given by the Board continued to be
             30.6.2007.

                                        -2-
        17.1 As per the standard guidelines of the Board for preparation of
        rehabilitation scheme, the company was required to be regular in the
        payment all its current dues arising after the cut-off-date, since the
        recovery of such dues was not covered in the proposed rehabilitation
        scheme.

        17.2 The Bench observed from the company's audited balance sheet
        for 2006-07 that the company was working and paying the current
        statutory dues also.

        17.3 Therefore, the Bench permits the Commercial Tax Department,
        Government of Uttar Pradesh to recover its outstanding dues, due
        after 30.6.2007, i.e. the cut-off-date given by the Board vide its final
        order dated 12.3.2007 regarding preparation of the rehabilitation
        scheme."

         In view of the subsequent events, we are of the opinion that subject to the

parties seeking appropriate remedies thereagainst, interest of justice would be

subserved if the order of the High Court is set aside at this stage and we direct

accordingly.

         We may observe that we have not gone into the merit of the matter and it

would be open to the parties to take recourse to such remedies as may be available to

them in law.

                                    -3-
         The appeal is disposed of with the aforementioned observation and direction.

                  (S.B. SINHA)
