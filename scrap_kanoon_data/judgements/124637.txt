K. MUNNI                                                          ....   PETITIONER(S)

                                           :VERSUS:

KASIMOHANTY SRIKANT PATNAIK                                       ...    RESPONDENT(S)


                                           ORDER

             Having regard to the fact that the petitioner is now employed in Bangalore

    and she has also filed a complaint petition as against the respondent, we are of the

    opinion that no purpose shall be served by transferring the F.C.O.P. No. 157 of 2007

    from the Family Court at Secunderabad in the State of Andhra Pradesh, to the Court

    of District Judge at Trissur in the State of Kerala.



             We would, however, request the XIII Additional Chief Metropolitan

    Magistrate as also the Family Court at Secunderabad to fix the cases between the

    parties on the same dates as far as practicable. Both the XIII Additional Chief

    Metropolitan Magistrate as also the Family Court, in any event, shall fix specific dates

    of hearing and shall not, save and except for cogent reasons, grant any adjournment

    in the matter(s).


                                          -2-
             If any occasion arises as regards her security, the petitioner may inform the
Senior Superintendent of Police who may pass appropriate orders.



        Respondent shall bear the costs of the petitioner for attending the Court, as

may be quantified by the Family Court.

        The transfer petition is disposed of accordingly.
