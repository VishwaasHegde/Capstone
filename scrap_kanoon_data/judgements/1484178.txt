CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.362 OF 2008
(Arising out of S.L.P. (Crl.) No.4815 of 2007)
With Criminal Appeal Nos.363 and 364 of 2008
   (Arising out of S.L.P. (Crl.) Nos.5316 and 5564 of 2007)



Criminal Appeal Nos.363 and 364 of 2008 arising out of
S.L.P. (Crl.) Nos.5316 and 5564 of 2007:

	Heard learned counsel for the parties.
	Leave granted.
	The appellants of these appeals were convicted by the Trial Court under 
Section 412 of the Indian Penal Code [hereinafter referred to as the `I.P.C.'] and 
sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of ten years.  On appeal 
being preferred, the High Court converted the conviction under Section 412 I.P.C. 
into one under Section 411 I.P.C. and sentenced the appellants to undergo rigorous 
imprisonment for a period of three years.  Hence, these appeals by special leave.
	It has been stated that the appellants have remained in custody for a 
period of about three months.

	In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that ends of 
justice would be met in case the sentence of imprisonment awarded against the 
appellants is reduced to the period already undergone by them.  
	Accordingly, the appeals are allowed in-part and the imprisonment 
awarded against the appellants is reduced to the period already undergone by them.
Criminal  Appeal No.362 of 2008 arising  out  of S.L.P. (Crl.) No.4815 of 2007:
	Heard learned counsel for the parties.
	Leave granted.
	The appellant was tried and acquitted by the Trial Court of the charge 
under Section 85(a) of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 [hereinafter referred 
to as, `the Act'].  On appeal being preferred, the High Court reversed the order of 
acquittal and convicted the appellant under Section 85(a) of the Act and sentenced 
him to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months and to pay fine of 
Rs.5,000/-; in default, to suffer further imprisonment for a period of one week.
	Having perused the judgment rendered by the Trial Court, we are of the 
view that order of acquittal cannot be said to be perverse; as such, the High Court 
was not justified in reversing the same.
	Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the impugned order passed by the High 
Court is set aside and the order of acquittal rendered by the Trial Court is restored.
