(Arising out of SLP(C) NO. 12349/2006)								                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
	Leave granted.

	After the award passed by the Arbitrator, appellant challenged the Award under 
Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, `the Act').  The 
appellant also filed application under Section 9 of the Act for granting stay of the 
award.  The said application has been rejected both by the Principal Civil Court and 
the High Court.

	While rejecting the application filed under Section 9 of the Act, both the Courts relied 
on the decision rendered by 2-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of National 
Aluminium Co. Ltd. Vs. Pressteel &amp; Fabrications (P) Ltd. and Anr.  reported in  2004 
(1) SCC 540.  We have been taken through the entire judgment of this Court. In  
National Aluminium's case (supra), this Court did not consider the provisions of 
Section 9 of the Act at all.  In that view of the matter, we are of the view that the said 
judgment is distinguishable in the facts of the present case. 

	In that view of the matter, the order of the High Court is set aside and the appeal is 
allowed.

	Let application under Section 9 of the Act be considered by the Principal Civil Judge 
independently on its own merits.
