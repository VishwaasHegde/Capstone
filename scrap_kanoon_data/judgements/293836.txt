		O R D E R

WRIT PETITION (CRL.)NO.135/2003
	In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution the petitioner prays for 
quashing of Annexures P-1, P-2 and P-3.  Annexure P-1 is a publication in India 
Today. No particular has been disclosed by the petitioner. Annexure P-2 is the 
publication in Hindustan Times. No material particular has been disclosed. Annexure 
P-3 is list of accused granted remission by the Government.  Charge under Section 
302 IPC in respect of accused/Kulwant Singh has been shown to have withdrawn on 
03.12.2001. In the list  Annexure P-3 besides Kulwant Singh none of the accused 
has been convicted/charged under Section 302 IPC. Therefore, the contention of the 
learned counsel appearing for the petitioner that the accused who has been convicted 
under Section 302 IPC. has been arbitrarily released prematurely is not 
substantiated. This petition being abuse of the process of the Court is accordingly 
dismissed.

WRIT PETITION (CRL.)NO.200/2003
	In view of our order passed in WRIT PETITION (CRL.)NO.135/2003 this 
petition is dismissed.

WRIT PETITION (CRL.)NO.267/2003
	In this writ petition petitioner prays for the following reliefs :
a.	Issue notice on the Union of India and States and Uts. of the 
Union.
b.	Issue  writ in the  nature of writ of mandamus/ order or 
direction to the respondents for releasing life convicts after 14 years 
term in jail generally and to release all life convicts particularly 
detailed in Annexures P-2 to P-4. 
c.	Constitute an expert Committee to deal with the case of life 
convicts languishing in jail even after 14 years term.
d.	In the alternative, issue an appropriate writ, order or direction 
to the Respondent Union of India, the States and the Union 
Territories to frame uniform rules and guidelines for exercise of 
powers under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution keeping large 
reservoir of power to deal with exceptional situations as observed in 
the Maru Ram case but subject to recording of reasons;
e.	Issue an appropriate writ, order or direction to the Respondent 
Union of India, the States and the Union Territories to treat the 
mandatory minimum period of 14 years to be served by certain life 
convicts under Section 433-A as only one of the guidelines under 
Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution.

					     ...3/-

			: 3 :
f. Issue an appropriate writ, order or direction that all the cases of life 
convicts must mandatorily and automatically be reviewed by a board 
after a specified period (which in the case of convicts covered under 
Section 433A of the Cr.P.C. is at the end of 13 years in prison) on an 
individual basis under the above guidelines to consider whether the 
convict should be released or not;
g. 	Direct the Respondents to educate the prisoners on their right 
to be considered for premature release and provide adequate legal aid 
for the same.
h. 	Issue any order or direction as this Hon'ble Court finds fit and 
proper in the circumstances of the case.

	Mr. K. Venugopal, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner at the outset 
fairly submits that he is not pressing prayer Nos. a and b.  On a reading of the 
prayers from c to h, we are afraid that in exercise of power under Article 32 of the 
Constitution such prayer could be acceded.  The prayer, inter alia,  seeks direction to 
amend a law  which power this court does not have.  At the same time, the learned 
counsel for the petitioner has also brought to our notice that in the case of Andhra 
Pradesh as many as 1500 hardcore prisoners have been prematurely released. It is no 
doubt true that power under Articles  72 and 161, or under Section  433-A can not be 
exercised arbitrarily, as pointed out by this Court in Maru Ram vs. Union of India 
and others, (1981) 1 SCC 107. However, there is another difficulty to give effective 
relief. The alleged  prematurely released 1500 hardcore prisoners are not before us. 
Therefore, it is difficult to give effective relief  in exercise  of our power under Article 
32 of the Constitution.

			: 4 :
We, however, clarify that if there are instances that the power has been exercised 
arbitrarily by the State Government it is open to the petitioner to challenge such 
arbitrary exercise of power before the High Court under Article 226 of the 
Constitution  after impleading the prisoners released prematurely as respondents.
	Subject to the aforesaid observation, we see no merit in this petition. The writ 
petition is dismissed accordingly. 
	Application for impleadment is dismissed.

CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 406 OF 2004



SHAMIM AHMED &amp; ORS.    				...APPELLANT (S)


VERSUS


STATE OF U.P. &amp; ORS.      				...RESPONDENT(S)


     

O R D E R


	    This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 27th September, 2001 passed by 
the Division Bench of the High Court of Allahabad.  By the aforesaid order the High Court has set 
aside the Government Order dated 11th January, 2000 and 25th January, 2000 granting remission 
to the appellants purportedly in exercise of power under Article 161 of the Constitution.  Para (i) 
of the aforesaid Order provides premature release of the category of prisoners as under:
(i)	Prisoners who had undergone 20 years of sentence with remission by 
26.1.2000;

(ii)	Male prisoners of 60 years or above, who had been sentenced to 
imprisonment for life and had undergone 3 years of sentence (without 
remission) by 26.1.2000;

(iii)	Lady prisoners of 50 years or above who had been sentenced to 
imprisonment for life and had undergone 3 years of sentence (without 
remission) by 26.1.2000;

(iv)	Male prisoners of 60 years or above who had been sentenced to a fixed 
term of imprisonment and undergone 1/3 of the sentence imposed upon 
them or 2 years which ever is less;

(v)	Lady prisoners of 50 years or above who had been sentenced to a fixed 
term of imprisonment and had undergone 1/3 of the sentence imposed 
upon them or 2 years which ever is less.
	The High Court has quashed the aforesaid order on the ground that the power has been 
exercised arbitrarily and in violation of the statutory provisions of Section 433A of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure.
	After hearing the learned counsel for the appellants and going through the judgment of 
the High Court, we entirely agree with the view taken by the Division Bench of the High Court.  
A perusal of Clause (ii) of the Government Order discloses the male prisoners of 60 years or 
above, who had been sentenced to imprisonment for life and had undergone 3 years of sentence 
(without remission) by 26.1.2000 and clause (iii) discloses the  lady prisoners of 50 years or 
above who had been sentenced to imprisonment for life and had undergone 3 years of sentence 
(without remission) by 26.1.2000.
	Validity of Section 433A of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been challenged before 
a Constitution Bench of this Court in Maru Ram Vs. Union of India &amp; Others [1981 (1) SCC 
107] in which this Court had upheld the validity of Section 433A.  This Court also pointed out 
that even the power under Article 72 and 161 of the Constitution should not be exercised 
arbitrarily.  Counsel for the appellants contended that the order of remand has been passed by 
the State Government in exercise of power under Article 161 of the Constitution which is quite 
different from the power under Section 433A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  While 
reading the order of the Government it appears that even assuming the Government has 
exercised power under Article 161 of the Constitution, it appears to be quite arbitrary and the 
High Court was justified in setting aside the aforesaid order.
	In the result, there are no merits in this appeal and the same is dismissed.
	We clarify that if any appellants have completed 14 years of actual imprisonment, he or 
they may approach the State Government/concerned authority for appropriate orders and the 
concerned authority shall dispose of the petition expeditiously.
	The application for deletion of the name of respondents is dismissed.
