CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 1094 OF 2006



	Heard the learned senior counsel on both sides at length.
	Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case that the Award passed by 
the Arbitrator has been confirmed by the Single Judge and the Division Bench and the 
same has been made the Rule of the Court, we see no reason to interfere with the 
concurrent finding of facts.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed.  We, however, reduce 
the rate of interest awarded by the Arbitrator from 20 per cent to 18 per cent for the pre-
Award period.
	A question has also been raised as to whether, the amount deposited by the 
appellant should be treated as principle amount or towards the adjustment of interest.  
Since this Court, on 1.4.2005 has kept this question open, let this issue be decided by the 
Executing Court in accordance with law.
