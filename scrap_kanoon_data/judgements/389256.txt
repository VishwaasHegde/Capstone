CIVIL APPEAL NO.969 OF 2008
(@ SLP (C) NO.12064/2006)


1.	Leave granted.
2.	Heard both sides.
3.	The appellant State has filed this appeal against the order passed by the Division 
Bench of the High Court.  The respondent herein filed a writ petition for quashing the order 
dated 20.7.2002 whereby the State Government cancelled the arms license given to the 
respondent.  The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition and quashed the order issued 
by the Licensing Authority.  The State had preferred an appeal against the order passed by 
learned Single Judge.  The appellant State had raised certain serious questions regarding the 
license held by the respondent.  The Division Bench did not considered those questions and 
has disposed of the appeal by a short, virtually non-speaking order.  As it is a matter relating 
to the arms license, the State rightly feels aggrieved by the non-consideration of the questions 
raised before the Division Bench.  

4.	We, therefore, set aside the judgment of the Division Bench and request the High 
Court to consider the L.P.A., which is being restored to its file, on merits and dispose of the 
same in accordance with law.
5.	Appeal disposed of accordingly.  No costs.
