		Issue Rule.
		Heard learned counsel for the parties.
		The petitioner who was sentenced to undergo life imprisonment by 
Judgment dated 7.5.1984 of the Allahabad High Court was released on 26.1.2000 on 
remission granted by the Governor of Uttar Pradesh by Orders dated 12.1.2000 and 
25.1.2000.  Thereafter, the orders of remission passed by the Governor was set aside by 
the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in its order dated 
27.9.2001 and the petitioner was re-arrested.  
		The petitioner has submitted that as he has already completed 14 years of 
imprisonment on 26.1.2000, without remission, he may be released.  The learned counsel 
for respondents confirmed the said position.  In similar circumstances, this Court had 
passed orders to release such persons.  

						-2-
		We, therefore, direct that the petitioner be released from custody forthwith 
as he has already completed 14 years of imprisonment, if not required in any other case.
		The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
