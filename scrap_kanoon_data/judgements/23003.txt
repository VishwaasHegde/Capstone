                            CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 165 OF 2007

GANGARAM                                                       ...    APPELLANT(S)
                                         :VERSUS:
STATE OF M.P.                                                  ...    RESPONDENT(S)


                                         ORDER

             Appellants were convicted for commission of an offence purported to be

     under Section 8 read with Section 21 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic

     Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act, for short), having been found in possession of 12

     gms. of the contraband from each of them.

             Our attention has been drawn to Section 21(a) and (b) of the NDPS Act

     which read as under:

                      "21. Whoever, in contravention of any provision this Act
             or any rule or order made or condition of licence granted
             thereunder, manufactures, possesses, sells, purchases, transports,
             imports inter-State, exports inter-State or uses any manufactured
             drug or any preparation containing any manufactured drug shall be
             punishable,-

                                        -2-
                  (a) where the contravention involves small quantity, with
         rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months,
         or with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both;
                  (b) where the contravention involves quantity, lesser than
         commercial quantity but greater than small quantity, with rigorous
         imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and with
         fine which may extend to one lakh rupees."



         Indisputably, the appellants are in custody since 28.2.2000 i.e. for a period of

more than eight years. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, we

are of the opinion that they did not deserve maximum punishment prescribed under

Section 21(b) of the NDPS Act, applying the doctrine of proportionality in imposing

the sentence vis-a-vis the object and purport thereof as has been provided for in the

NDPS Act.


         We are, therefore, of the opinion that interest of justice would be subserved

if the sentence imposed upon the        appellants is reduced to the period already

undergone by them, including for the default clause.




                                     -3-
         The appellants are in jail. They are directed to be set at liberty forthwith.

         The appeals are allowed accordingly.
