CIVIL APPEAL NO.5165 OF 2002 

	We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned judgment in view of the fact that the 
High Court in its discretion has directed the appellants-authority to consider the respondent's 
case and dispose of the same in accordance with law.  Accordingly, we do not fine any merit in the 
appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed.  There shall be no order as to costs.
