     				CIVIL APPEAL NO.8064 OF 2001 		

	Heard learned counsel for the parties.

	This appeal is filed against an interim order dated 09.08.2001 passed by the High Court of 
Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in C.M.No.4010/2001 in R.S.A.No.1929/91.  While issuing 
notice on 05.10.2001, status quo was ordered to be maintained by this Court as regards property 
which is still continuing.  We are informed by the learned counsel that the second appeal is pending 
before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh.  Considering the facts and 
circumstances of the case, we request the High Court to dispose of the second appeal as early as 
possible and preferably within a period of one year from the date of communication of this Order. 
The status quo granted by this Court which is still continuing would also continue till the disposal of 
the second appeal. 
	The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
	There shall be no order as to costs.
