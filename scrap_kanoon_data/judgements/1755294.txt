CIVIL APPEAL NO.5891 OF 2005
With Civil Appeal No.5892 of 2005


	Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the impugned order.  
	The Custodian filed a petition before the Special Court (Trial of Offences 
Relating to Transactions in Securities) at Bombay, giving rise to Miscellaneous 
Petition No.73 of 1998, which has been allowed by the impugned order.  In the said 
petition, it has been mentioned that provisions of the Limitation Act shall have no 
application to the said petition.  In the written statement filed on behalf of the 
appellants, it was asserted that the aforesaid petition filed by the Custodian was 
barred by limitation and fit to be dismissed.  It appears that no issue was framed by 
the Special Court on the plea of limitation.  In our view, in view of the pleadings of the 
parties, the Special Court should have framed an issue on the question of limitation as 
well and decided the same along with other issues and the same having not been done, 
the impugned order cannot be allowed to be maintained.

	Accordingly, the civil appeals are allowed, impugned order is set aside and 
the matter is remanded to the Special Court to decide the petition afresh on all the 
points, including the question of limitation.  It may be clarified that we should not be 
misunderstood to have expressed any opinion one way or the other in relation to the 
applicability or otherwise of the provisions of the Limitation Act and the same will be 
also decided by the Special Court.
