CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1086 OF 2008
[Arising out of SLP(C) No.17169/2004]

	Leave granted. 

	Heard the parties.

	This appeal is filed by the State impugning the judgment and order dated 14/11/2003 
passed in Writ Petition No.1761/2002.  By the impugned order, the High Court directed 
the appellant to grant pension and pensionary benefits to the respondent within a period 
of three months from the date of order failing which the arrears of pension shall carry 
interest  18% per annum from the date of judgment till repayment of arrears and 
thereafter payment of regular monthly pension.

	The respondent is stated to be working as an Assistant Teacher in Shivaji 
Mahavidyalaya, Lakhandur.  He obtained voluntary retirement on 30/04/1973. He filed a 
Writ Petition No.1761/2002  under  Article  226  of  the  Constitution after 
......2.

- 2 -

almost 30 years of his retirement seeking a mandamus for a direction for payment of 
pension and pensionary benefits.  It is now a well-settled principle of law that delay 
defeats equity.  The discretionary relief that is granted by the High Court under Article 
226 of the Constitution is an equitable relief.  The fact of having approached the High 
Court after almost 30 years of retirement itself deserves dismissal on the ground of 
laches and negligence without going into the merit.  

	For the reasons afore-stated, the High Court fell into error by entertaining the writ 
petition after enormous delay of almost 30 years.  On this sole ground, the writ petition 
was liable to be dismissed without going into the merits.  Consequently, the impugned 
order passed by the High Court is not tenable in law.  It is, accordingly, set aside.  The 
appeal is allowed.  No costs.
