         Leave granted.

         Having heard learned counsel for the appellant-husband and after going through the

impugned judgement and order of the High Court, we are of the view that the maintenance as

directed by the trial court and as affirmed by the High Court shall be modified to the extent of

Rs.5,500/- p.m. instead of Rs.6,350/- p.m. and the arrears of maintenance shall be calculated in

that fashion. We order accordingly. The appeal is disposed of. There shall be no order as to

costs.
