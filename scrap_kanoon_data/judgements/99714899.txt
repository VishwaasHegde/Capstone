SHERRY                                                            ...   RESPONDENT(S)




                                         ORDER

             Leave granted.

             This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 10.1.2008

    passed by the High Court of Kerala in C.R.P. No.1015/2005, whereby and whereunder

    an additional compensation for a sum of Rs. 1,47,256/- has been granted by way of

    compensation for the trees cut for     drawing overhead electrical line in terms of

    provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act.


             The issue involved in this appeal is since covered by a decision of this Court

    in Kerala State Electricity Board vs. Livisha &amp; Ors.,[2007 (6) SCC 792] followed in

    Kerala State Electricity Board vs. B. Sreekumari, [2008(5) SCC 398].




                                        -2-
         In that view of the matter, we are of the opinion that interest of justice

would be subserved if the impugned judgment is set aside and the matter is remitted

to the High Court for consideration thereof afresh in the light of the aforesaid

decisions of this Court. We direct accordingly.

         The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No costs.
