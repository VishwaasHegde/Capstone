       CIVIL APPEAL NO.1663 OF 2008 
(Arising out of SLP(C)No.5463 of 2007)  (CC No.12608) 			

	Delay condoned.
	Leave granted.
	This appeal is directed against the judgment and final order dt.24.04.2007 passed by the 
High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandiagrh in C.W.P.No.16957 of 2006 by which the High 
Court has affirmed the award passed by the Labour Court with 50% back wages to be paid to the 
respondent.
	Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the order 
regarding payment of 50% back wages be modified by 25% of back wages to be paid to the 
respondent. We order accordingly.  With this modification, the order of the High Court is 
affirmed.  The appeal is disposed of accordingly.  There shall be no order as to costs.
