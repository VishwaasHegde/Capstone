  JAGDISH LAL DUA (DEAD) BY LRS.                                   ... RESPONDENTS


                                       ORDER

              Heard learned counsel for the appellant.

              This appeal is directed against the order of the High Court allowing the

  substitution application. Allowing of substitution application does not create any right.

  It is open to the appellant to urge all the contentions available to him under the law at

  the time of hearing of the appeal. It is also open to the appellant to urge that Jagdish

  Lal Dua is not a legal heir of Bhag Chand @ Subhash Chand.

              With the aforesaid clarification, the appeals are dismissed.
