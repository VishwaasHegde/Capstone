O R D E R
[Arising out of SLP(C) No. 2278/2007]

	Leave granted.
	Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the 
impugned order having been passed without giving an opportunity of hearing to the 
appellant, the same cannot be sustained, it is set aside accordingly. The appellant may 
file counter affidavit in the writ petition before the High Cort, within four weeks and 
rejoinder thereto, if any, by the writ petitioners as also by the MCD, may be filed 
within two weeks thereafter.	
	We would request the High Court to consider the desirability of disposing of the 
matter as expeditiously as possible.  
	The appeal is disposed of with the aforementioned observation and direction.
