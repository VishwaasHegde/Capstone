				    	O R D E R
				CIVIL APPEAL NO.  893  OF 2008
			 [Arising out of SLP(C)No.26252 of 2005]

	Leave granted.
	By a demand notice dated 22nd September, 2003 the Administration of  Dadra and Nagar 
Haveli, in its Electricity Department demanded a sum of Rs.1,70,58,412.00 from the 
appellants on account of un-metered electricity said to have been consumed by the 
appellants.  Pursuant to the said notice, various sums were deposited by the appellants till 6th 
December, 2004 when by a fresh notice of even date, the appellants were directed to pay the 
balance sum of Rs.70,42,887 within 10 days from the date of the issue of the letter, failing 
which the power supply to their establishment would stand disconnected without further 
notice.

	Challenging the said notice, the appellants moved the High Court, which ultimately 
dismissed their writ petition but granted six weeks time to move this Court.  The appellants, 
accordingly, moved this Court by way of special leave petition No.26252 of 2005 and on 5th 
January, 2006 this Court directed notice to issue only on the limited question regarding 
payment of the balance amount of Rs.74 lakhs within further time than had been granted by 
the High Court.  In the said order, the appellants were also directed to continue to deposit a 
sum of Rs.15 lakhs per month till  full payment was made.
	It has now been submitted  by an affidavit filed by the appellants that the entire amount has 
been paid.  Nothing, accordingly, survives in the appeal.  However, as pointed out by learned 
counsel appearing for the respondents, the question of payment of interest still remains to be 
decided.			
	We, accordingly, dispose of this appeal by recording the fact that the balance amount has 
been paid and  the power supply to the appellants establishment should not, therefore, be 
disconnected on this  count.   However,  the  respondents  will  be  at liberty to

compute the interest, if any, payable and to raise a fresh demand in respect thereof.
	There will be no orders as to costs.
