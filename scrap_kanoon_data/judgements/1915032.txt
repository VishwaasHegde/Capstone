              CIVIL APPEAL NO.3081 OF 2008 @ SLP(C) NO.19027 OF 2004



                                          ORDER


           Permission to file SLP granted in SLP(C) No. 19027 of 2004.

           Delay condoned.

           Impleadment allowed.

           Leave granted.

           In these Appeals the main question which arises for determination is "whether in

 the State of Uttar Pradesh teachers appointed on honorarium basis should be allowed to

 continue even after selectees are made available, from time to time, duly selected by U.P.

 Higher Education Services Commission."
          By the impugned Order passed in Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No. 44332 of

2003, High Court has passed an across the Board direction to the concerned Authorities to

dismiss all the teachers appointed on honorarium basis (even without notice to the affected

parties) in following terms:


           "We therefore direct the concerned authorities including Secretary and
           Director of Higher Education and the U.P. Higher Education Services
           Commission that they must see to it that Mandeya appointments i.e.
           (honorarium basis) are not made any more and any appointment
           already made are terminated forthwith. The posts of lecturer in the
           Degree/P.G. Colleges should be filled strictly in accordance with the
           provisions of the Act i.e. by selection through the U.P. Higher
           Education Services Commission.

           The petition is dismissed with the above observations."
          Having heard learned counsel for the parties we find that on principle there is no

dispute as it is stated on behalf of the appellants and other such Teachers that as and when

selectees are made available they have to go.

          The only dispute is whether service of the appellants - teachers herein is liable to

be terminated on the ground that selectees in some cases are now available.

          Learned counsel appearing for the Management has submitted a Chart. According

to him the selectees in some cases are now available and to that extent services of the existing

teachers appointed on honorarium basis have to be terminated. Therefore, these matters are

now confined to working out the details.


          In the circumstances, we set aside the above quoted portion of the impugned

judgment and we restore Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No. 44332 of 2003, in which the

Management will have to show whether how many selectees are not cleared by the
Commission and against the number of posts to be filled in.

          The difficulty has arisen because the impugned order is passed in Civil

Miscellaneous Writ Petition No. 44332 of 2003 in the case of Malvika Shekhar Vs. Director,

Higher Education, U.P. &amp; Ors. whereunder the High Court vide sweeping direction has

directed the concerned authorities to see that appointment of all teachers on honorarium

basis should be immediately terminated. The said order which is quoted hereinabove is

passed even without hearing the affected parties. Therefore, to that extent alone, we set aside

the above quoted part of the order and we direct the High Court to once again consider the

said Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No. 44332 of 2003 in the light of the later

developments, namely, selection of certain candidates by U.P. Higher Education Service

Commission. It would be open to the affected parties to move an I.A. in the pending Writ

Petition No. 44332 of 2003 since the Management has prepared the Chart of number of

selectees to be fitted against some of the posts. If, however, the High Court is of the view

that every affected teacher should file separate Writ Petition, on the basis that they had not

done so earlier it may so direct accordingly.


          We make it clear that till the High Court decides the above matters, as directed

above, the present status quo will continue.

          Accordingly, to above extent, the said Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No. 44332

of 2003 filed in the High Court stands restored to the file of the High Court for fresh disposal

in accordance with law.

          Civil Appeals stand disposed of accordingly.
