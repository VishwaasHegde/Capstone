	These appeals had come up before this Court on 12th December 2007 and at the 
request of learned senior counsel appearing for the Department, the same were adjourned 
for six weeks to enable him to get instructions as to whether the clarification issued by the 
Department under Notification No.463/86-CE dated 09th December 1986 would be 
applicable to Exemption Notification No.462/86-CE dated 09th December 1986.  The 
order passed on 12th December 2007 reads as under :
	"The question for consideration in the present appeals is 'Whether the 
chassis fitted with engines manufactured and cleared by the appellants for 
further manufacture of buses are eligible for the concessional rate of excise 
duty under exemption Notification No.462/86-CE dated 9.12.1986 or not'.

	Notifications similar to notification No.462/86 have been issued by the 
department from time to time.  One such exemption notification is Notification 
No.463/86-CE.

	The Department of Excise and Customs issued a general   clarification  
dated  17th  September, 1987  clarifying that the chasis for the LCVs (Light 
Motor Vehicles like the one manufactured by the appellant) is included in the 
motor vehicles and thus entitled to the concessional rate of excise duty in terms 
of notification No. 463/86.  It may be mentioned here that notification No. 
463/86 is similar to the notification No. 462/86.  The order reads:

'I am directed to refer to your letter 
F.No.V.Ch.87(30)/17/TD/87/394 dated 13.8.87 on the above 
subject and to say that the concessional rate of excise duty 
prescribed under Notification No.463/86-CE dated 9.12.1986 is 
applicable also to the chasis for the LCVs specified in the said 
notification.'
 
	M/s. Ashok Leyland Limited which is also manufacturing LCVs had 
filed an application seeking clarification as to whether motor vehicles would 
include the chassis of LCVs as well.

	The Department of Industrial Development, Ministry of Industry vide 
its order dated 5th May, 1992 clarified that chassis of LCVs would be included 
in the motor vehicles.

	Clarifications issued by the Department of Excise &amp; Customs as well as 
the Ministry of Industry were produced before the appellate Tribunal but the 
Tribunal refused to give any finding on the same.

	Mr. Shetty, learned senior counsel appearing for the department seeks 
time to get clarification from the Central Board of Excise &amp; Customs as to 
whether the clarification issued by the department under notification No. 
463/86-Ce would be applicable to the exemption Notification No. 462/86-Ce 
dated 9.12.1986 as well.

	Adjourned by six weeks."
	Mr. Shetty, learned senior counsel appearing for the Department fairly  concedes that 
although  the briefing counsel

had sought the clarification in the light of the aforesaid order by intimating the Central 
Agency, no instructions have been received.  
	We find that the point in issue raised before us was also raised before the Tribunal 
(refer to para 3.2 of the impugned order), but, the Tribunal has not recorded any finding 
on the same.  
	Mr. Shetty prays that the impugned order be set aside and the case be remitted to the 
Tribunal for a fresh decision on all the points raised in the appeal in accordance with law.  
Ordered accordingly.
	All contentions are left open.  The Tribunal is directed to record its findings on the 
point which had been raised by the appellants including the applicability of the 
clarification issued by the Department with regard to Notification No.463/86-CE dated 
09th December 1986 to Notification No.462/86-CE dated 09th December 1986.
	The appeals are allowed accordingly.
C.A.NOS.5092-5094 OF 2002
	In the light of the order passed in C.A.Nos.1907-1909 of 2002 these appeals are also 
allowed as the question of re-computation of duty and penalty will depend upon the 
applicability of  the  clarification  issued  by the Department
