O R D E R
TRANSFER PETITION(C) NO. 108 OF 2007

	This is wife's petition for transfer.  The ground taken in this transfer petitions is that 
she is having a four year old son and she would be unable to go to Patna to contest the 
suit leaving behind her minor son.  The other ground taken is that she has also filed a 
maintenance application which is pending at Family Court at Bandra, Mumbai.  We are 
of the view that these are sufficient grounds for allowing the transfer petition.

	Accordingly, transfer petition is allowed.  Hindu Marriage Petition (HMP) 
No.113/2005 (Matrimonial Case No.113/2005) titled Shri Ashish Niranjan Vs. Moni 
Bhushan &amp; Anr. pending in the Family Court at Patna stands transferred to the Family 
Court at Bandra, Mumbai.
