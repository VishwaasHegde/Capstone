C.K. THAKKER, J.


1.       Leave granted.

2.       The present appeal is directed against

the order passed by the Division Bench of the

High Court of Judicature at Allahabad on May

21, 2007 in Special Appeal No. 232 of 2007.            By

the said order, the Division Bench allowed the

appeal   filed     by   Vishnu      Kant     Gupta-first

respondent   herein     and   set   aside     the   order

passed by the Company Judge on February 12,
                                                                        2


2007 in Miscellaneous Company Application No. 2

of 1993.

3.          The facts giving rise to the present

appeal are that Champaran Sugar Company Limited

was    in   financial       doldrums.           Proceedings       had

been    initiated       under           the   Sick     Industrial

Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 and

Board        of        Industrial             and          Financial

Reconstruction (BIFR), by its order dated June

28, 1993, held that there was no possibility of

rehabilitation of the Company and the Company

must be ordered to be wound up.                  Recommendation

was made to that effect by BIFR and it was

forwarded        to   the    High       Court    of    Allahabad.

Pursuant to the said recommendation, the High

Court passed an order for winding up of the

Company     on    September        5,    1994.        An   Official

Liquidator was appointed under the Companies

Act, 1956.

4.          On    January     4,    2000,       the   High      Court

directed      the     Official           Liquidator        to   take

appropriate proceedings for sale of Barachakia
                                                             3


and   Chanpatia    property    of    the     Company    in

liquidation. An advertisement was issued and

tenders were invited.      On January 31, 2001, the

matter was taken up by the Company Judge. On

behalf of one Hanuman Industries (India), its

counsel   Ms.     Geeta   Luthra    stated     that    the

Hanuman Industries was prepared to pay Rs.3.51

crores.   In support of the said bid, three bank

drafts totalling Rs.10 lakhs were deposited.

Vishnu Kant Gupta, respondent No. 1 herein had

also made offer of Rs.3.51 crores payable in

four equal quarterly instalments on condition

that the possession of the factory be given by

the Official Liquidator upon payment of first

instalment and on furnishing bank guarantee for

the   remaining      amount.        The    matter      was

negotiated with both the parties.          According to

IFCI, valuation given by respondent No. 1 was

`slightly lower' and correct valuation should

be Rs. 4,16,000/-. The parties were, therefore,

asked whether they were willing to increase the

offer.    M/s Hanuman Industries offered Rs.3.91
                                                                               4


crores and Vishnu Kant Gupta finally offered

Rs.     5     crores        payable           in        two     quarterly

instalments, i.e. in six months.                              The Company

Judge       having    regard           to    all        the    facts     and

circumstances         held       that        the   offer        of    Vishnu

Kant Gupta was adequate and should be accepted.

Accordingly      offer           of    Vishnu       Kant       Gupta     was

accepted.

5.           Before        the        period       of    three        months

fixed for the payment of first instalment could

expire on April 30, 2001, two Writ Appeals were

filed against the order passed by the Company

Judge and by orders dated February 7, 2001 and

March 13, 2001, interim stay was granted by the

Division Bench and operation of the order by

the    Company       Judge       was        stayed.           It     further

appears that nothing was done thereafter either

by the parties or by the Division Bench of the

High    Court        and    both        the        matters          remained

pending.        For    about           six    years,          the    appeals

remained pending and stay operated.                            As late as

on December 5, 2006, both the matters appeared
                                                                         5


on   Board.      Nobody      appeared       on    behalf    of     the

appellants and both the appeals were dismissed

for default and stay granted by the Division

Bench came to be vacated.

6.         After      the     dismissal          of   appeals      and

vacation of stay, notice was issued to Vishnu

Kant Gupta on February 8, 2007 since he was the

highest bidder.            He was served on February 14,

2007.     But even before the service of notice,

he came to know about the dismissal of appeals

and vacation of stay order and he deposited an

amount of Rs. 1.50 crores on February 9, 2007.

On   February        12,    2007,    he     offered      Rs.      1.55

crores     by    a    bank     draft       and    also     gave     an

undertaking to pay Rs. 2 crores within three

days.     Meanwhile, however, other persons also

gave offers.          One JHV Sugar offered Rs. 5.21

crores.         Similarly,      Shiv       Shakti     Chini    Mills

Pvt.     Ltd.    offered       Rs.     6    crores.      Likewise,

Sanjeev     Kumar          Chawdhary       offered       Rs.      6.50

crores.     The Company Judge in the circumstances

felt    that     it   would     be     in    the      interest      of
                                                                     6


Company to re-advertise and re-invite tenders.

Accordingly,       he     passed     an     order       for    re-

advertisement of tenders and re-invitation of

offers.

7.          The   respondent       herein     was   very      much

aggrieved by the order passed by the Company

Judge.      He felt that his offer of February,

2001 was the highest and more than six years

had passed.        Even according to Company Judge,

the offer made by the first respondent in 2001

was `reasonable' and hence it was accepted and

there was no ground to interfere with the said

action    and     the    order    passed     by   the    Company

Judge was illegal.               He, hence, preferred an

appeal against the order of the Company Judge.

The Division Bench of the High Court considered

the facts and circumstances of the case and

held that the grievance of the appellant was

well-founded       and    the     Company    Judge      was    not

justified in setting aside the highest offer

made   by   the    respondent       and     accepted     by   the

Company     Judge.        The     Court     noted    that     the
                                                                         7


respondent No. 1 had not paid the amount, but

it was because of stay granted by the Division

Bench    in    February,        2001.       When     appeals      were

dismissed,         respondent         No.     1    had    shown    his

readiness and willingness to pay the amount and

within a period of about one week, he paid more

than Rs. 3 crores and also gave an undertaking

to pay balance amount of Rs. 2 crores within

three   days.           The    Division       Bench,      therefore,

held    that       at   the    most    the        first   respondent

should pay interest @ 10% from December 5, 2006

when the appeals were dismissed up to February

9, 2007 when the respondent No. 1 made first

payment of Rs. 1.50 crores.                       The said amount

came to about Rs. 10 lakhs.

8.        Accordingly, respondent No. 1 paid Rs.

5 crores as per the bid accepted by the Company

Judge and Rs. 10,40,000/- towards interest as

ordered       by    the   Division          Bench    of     the   High

Court. Appellants herein, namely, IFCI and IDBI

have    challenged            the     order        passed    by    the

Division Bench by filing the present appeal.
                                                                    8
9.             Notice was issued by this Court on

August 27, 2007. The respondents appeared and

waived       service.         Time    was   granted     to   file

affidavit in reply as well as rejoinder.                       By

way of ad interim relief, status quo as on that

day was also granted.                Considering the nature

of    litigation,       the    Registry     was    directed    to

place the matter for final hearing and that is

how the matter has been placed before us.

10.          We have heard the learned counsel for

the parties.

11.          The learned counsel for the appellants

contended that the Division Bench of the High

Court was wholly wrong in setting aside the

order passed by the Company Judge.                       It was

submitted that the Company Judge was right in

setting aside the sale and in inviting fresh

offers.       It was also submitted that the first

respondent had paid `paltry amount' of Rs. 10

lakhs before six years and the Division Bench

was    not    justified       in     directing    the   Official

Liquidator to hand over possession of the Unit
                                                                           9


for     the     amount       on     which    the       auction      was

undertaken in January, 2001 when no payment was

made by the first respondent for a pretty long

time.    It was also submitted that for about six

years, the respondent had not done anything.

Apart    from        the    fact     that    he       had    not    made

payment to the Official Liquidator, he had also

not    shown        his    readiness       and    willingness         by

depositing the amount in the Company Court so

that it could be invested in any nationalized

bank    and     could       earn    interest.          Resultantly,

almost    the        entire       amount    remained         with   the

purchaser and now he wants to take advantage

though much more attractive and higher offers

have    already           been    received       by   the    Official

Liquidator.

12.           Relying on various decisions of this

Court,        the    counsel        submitted         that    as    per

settled law, acceptance of offer by the highest

bidder does not confer vested right in him to

get the property.                It is not only the power,
                                                                            1
                                                                            0
but the duty of the Company Court to ensure

that proper, adequate and reasonable price is

fetched in respect of the property which is to

be    sold    in       public      auction.         It    is    in    the

interest          of    the    Company,      its        shareholders,

creditors, workers as well as in larger public

interest.              It    was   also   submitted        that      this

Court has held that even if sale is confirmed

by    a   Court        and    it   has    been     brought      to   the

notice       of    the       Court   that     property         has    not

fetched proper, adequate and reasonable price,

even confirmed sale can be set aside.                            [Divya

Manufacturing Company v. Union of India &amp; Ors.,

(2006) 6 SCC 69].

13.          The        appellants        herein        are    secured

creditors.             The said fact ought to have been

taken into consideration by the Division Bench.

As the impugned order is not in consonance with

well-established               principles          of     law,        the

appellants         are       constrained      to    approach         this

Court.       It was, therefore, submitted that the

appeal deserves to be allowed by setting aside
                                                                               1
                                                                               1
the order passed by the Division Bench of the

High     Court    by        restoring       the        order    of      the

Company    Judge       directing        him       to    expedite         the

process     of     re-advertisement                    and     sale      of

property.

14.          The       learned       counsel        for      the     first

respondent, on the other hand, contended that

admittedly auction was held in January, 2001.

The highest bid of the first respondent was for

Rs. 5 crores which was accepted by the Company

Judge.     The first respondent was prepared to

pay the entire amount as per the terms and

conditions of the bid by the Company Judge.

There      was         no         default      on         his        part.

Unfortunately,              however,        two        appeals          were

preferred        and        the     Division        Bench       granted

interim    relief           in    February,       2001.         It      was

because    of     the       interim    order        passed         by   the

Division Bench of the High Court that the first

respondent could not pay the amount. For the

act of Court, the first respondent should not

suffer.     When the appeals were dismissed for
                                                                                1
                                                                                2
default          and        interim          relief        was     vacated,

immediately,               he    made    part       payment       and    also

stated that he would be paying the remaining

amount within a very short period.                                 If after

six years, someone comes forward and says that

he    is    inclined             to    pay     higher      amount,       sale

cannot      be     set          aside    on     such    ground.           The

counsel submitted that the decisions on which

reliance         has       been       placed    by    the    appellants,

support the case of the first respondent that

though it is the duty of the Court to ensure

that       the     property             fetches        reasonable         and

adequate price, it is equally well-settled that

once the Court finds that the price offered is

adequate,         no         subsequent            higher        offer    can

constitute             a        valid     ground        for        refusing

confirmation of sale.

15.          In the instant case, the facts clearly

reveal      that           initial        offer       of     the     first-

respondent was for Rs.3.51 crores, but after

negotiations, it was the first respondent who

had    taken      it        up    to    Rs.    5    crores       which   was
                                                                               1
                                                                               3
accepted.          In      the    circumstances,             the       order

passed by the Division Bench is strictly in

accordance         with     law    and        no     interference         is

called for.

16.        It        was       also         submitted        that        the

Division      Bench        has    considered          the    fact       that

after dismissal of appeal, the first respondent

ought    to     have       made    payment           immediately         and

since there was a gap of about three months,

the     Division           Bench            directed        the        first

respondent to pay interest @ 10% which came to

Rupees ten lakhs.                 The said amount has been

paid by the first respondent.                      But even if this

Court    feels        that       the        said     amount       is     not

adequate,       an       appropriate           direction          may     be

issued so that additional amount as this Court

deems    fit       can     also        be     paid     by    the       first

respondent.

17.        Having heard the learned counsel for

the     parties,          in     our        opinion,        the    appeal

deserves      to     be    partly           allowed.        So     far    as

principles         relating            to     auction        sale        and
                                                                        1
                                                                        4
confirmation thereof are concerned, the law is

well-settled. Very recently, in FCS Software

Solutions Ltd. v. LA Medical Devices Ltd. &amp;

Ors., JT (2008) 7 SC 499, we have elaborately

dealt with all these principles and it is not

necessary to burden this judgment by referring

to    all     the    cases     by    reiterating      the        said

principles.

18.                 On      the     facts     and         in      the

circumstances of the case, however, one very

eloquent fact cannot be lost sight of.                     Highest

bid of Rs. 5 crores by respondent No. 1 was

accepted by the Company Judge on January 31,

2001.       But the record discloses that an amount

of    Rs.    10    lakhs    only    had   been     paid    by     the

successful               bidder-respondent           No.           1.

Ordinarily, when the highest bid of intending

purchaser has been accepted, he is required to

pay 25% of purchase-price immediately.                         It had

not    been       done.     The     amount   was    substantial

inasmuch as the highest bid was of Rs.5 crores
                                                                               1
                                                                               5
and     the    first          respondent         was        required      to

deposit       an   amount       of     Rs.1.25       crores.            Even

thereafter, nothing was done by him.                                  Thus,

neither 25% amount (1.25 crores) nor 75% amount

(3.75 crores) was paid by him. True it is that

in February and March, 2001, stay was granted

by the Division Bench, but we cannot ignore the

fact    that       the        price       quoted       by     the     first

respondent         of    Rs.    5     crores       was      in   January,

2001.     Had the amount been paid at the relevant

time by the first respondent or had it been

deposited       in      any    natinalised          Bank,        it   would

have earned a sizeable interest which has not

been    done.           After       the    stay    was       vacated      in

December, 2006, payment was made by the first

respondent only in 2007, i.e. after more than

six years.

19.           In the circumstances, though we agree

with     the       learned          counsel        for       the      first

respondent that higher offer of Rs. 6.5 crores

in    2007     cannot         invalidate         highest         offer    of

first     respondent           of     Rs.    5     crores        made    in
                                                                    1
                                                                    6
January, 2001, but at the same time, we cannot

also be oblivious and unmindful of the fact

that out of Rs. 5 crores in January, 2001, the

first respondent had parted with a negligible

amount of of Rs. 10 lakhs only at that time.

Before    the    Division        Bench   it    was   argued    on

behalf of the present appellants that even if

the    Court    is   of    the    view   that    the   sale   in

favour of respondent No. 1 should not be set

aside, he should be ordered to pay 18% interest

from 2001 to 2007. The Division Bench observed

that    such    amount     of    interest      would   come    to

about Rs. 10 crores.               We appreciate that in

view of the above fact, the Division Bench was

justified in not accepting the prayer of the

appellants herein and not directing the first

respondent to pay additional amount of Rs. 10

crores.    But we are also of the view that the

Division       Bench      was    wrong   and     not   at     all

justified in ordering payment of interest only

from December, 2006 to February, 2007.                        The

admitted position is that the first respondent
                                                                        1
                                                                        7
had paid only Rs. 10 lakhs as against Rs. 5

crores    which       was    also    equally       relevant       and

important factor. In our considered opinion,

while    exercising         discretionary      and       equitable

jurisdiction          under     Article        136       of       the

Constitution, we have to bear in mind the said

fact as well which is very important, relevant

and material.

20.       On overall considerations and for the

reasons stated hereinabove, in our judgment,

ends of justice would be served if we direct

that    sale    in    favour    of    first    respondent         be

confirmed       with        condition    that        the      first

respondent will pay an additional amount of Rs.

three crores.          It will be over and above the

payment    which      has     been    made    by    him.         Such

payment will be made within a period of three

months. If the payment is not made as per this

order,    the        first    respondent       will        not     be

entitled to claim any right on the basis of the

bid made and accepted on January 31, 2001 and

fresh    auction      will     be    conducted      as    per    the
                                                                             1
                                                                             8
order of the Company Judge.            The appeal is

disposed   of   accordingly.   In      the         facts             and

circumstances of the case, there will be no

order as to costs.
