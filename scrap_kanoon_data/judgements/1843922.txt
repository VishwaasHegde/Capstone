CIVIL APPEAL NO.1530 OF 2008
(Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.10110 of 2006)

	Heard learned counsel for the parties.
	Leave granted.
	Both the parties stated that the matter has been settled between them and, 
pursuant to which, title deeds have been already made over by the learned counsel 
appearing on behalf of the appellants to the learned counsel appearing on behalf of 
the respondents in court.  It has been further stated that, as the parties have settled 
the main matter, F.I.R. No.292 dated 20th June, 2004, registered at P.S. Sadar, 
Jalandhar, within the State of Punjab, against the accused persons should be quashed.  
In our view, to set the matter at rest, it would be expedient to quash the prosecution of 
the accused persons arising out of the aforesaid First Information Report.  
Accordingly, prosecution of the accused persons in the case arising out of the 
aforesaid First Information Report is hereby quashed.
	The civil appeal is, accordingly, disposed of.
